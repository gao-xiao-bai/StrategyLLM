Question: The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of days between the first day of the year and the first Monday of the year. Then, we can add this number of days to the first day of the year to find the date of the first Monday.

First, let's determine the day of the week for the first day of the year. We know that the first day of 2019 is a Tuesday.

Next, let's determine the day of the week for the first Monday of the year. Since the first day of the year is a Tuesday, we need to find the number of days between Tuesday and Monday. There are 6 days between Tuesday and Monday.

Now, let's add the number of days between the first day of the year and the first Monday of the year to the first day of the year. Since the first day of the year is January 1st, 2019, we can add 6 days to find the date of the first Monday.

Therefore, the date today is 01/07/2019.

Answer: The answer is 01/07/2019.

Question: Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date yesterday in MM/DD/YYYY?
Solution: To find the date yesterday, we need to subtract 1 day from today's date. Since today is Jane's 16-year-old birthday, we can calculate her birth year by subtracting 16 from the current year. Since she was born on the last day of February, we need to consider the leap year as well. 

First, we check if the current year is a leap year. If it is, then the last day of February is 29th. Otherwise, it is 28th. 

In this case, the current year is 2017, which is not a leap year. So, the last day of February is 28th. 

To find yesterday's date, we subtract 1 from the current day. If the current day is 1st, then we set the day to the last day of the previous month. In this case, the current day is 28th, so yesterday's date will be 27th. 

Therefore, the date yesterday is 02/27/2017.

Answer: The answer is 02/27/2017.
