Strategy:
1. Determine the current date based on the given information.
2. Calculate the number of hours or days given in the question.
3. Determine if the time period given is in the past or future.
4. Adjust the current date based on the time period and direction (past or future).
5. Convert the adjusted date to the required format (MM/DD/YYYY) as specified in the question.
6. Provide the final date as the answer to the question.

Examples:
Question: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Solution:
1. Determine the current date based on the given information.
   - The current date is not explicitly given in the question, so we need to determine it based on the information provided.
   - We know that 2015 is coming in 36 hours, which means the current year is 2014.
   - We also know that the current date is one week before the date mentioned in the question.
   - Let's assume the current date is 12/30/2014.

2. Calculate the number of hours or days given in the question.
   - The question mentions one week from today, so we need to calculate the number of days in one week.
   - One week has 7 days.

3. Determine if the time period given is in the past or future.
   - The time period mentioned in the question is in the future because it says "one week from today."

4. Adjust the current date based on the time period and direction (past or future).
   - Since the time period is in the future, we need to add the number of days (7) to the current date.
   - 12/30/2014 + 7 days = 01/06/2015

5. Convert the adjusted date to the required format (MM/DD/YYYY) as specified in the question.
   - The adjusted date is already in the required format (MM/DD/YYYY).

6. Provide the final date as the answer to the question.
Answer: The answer is 01/06/2015.



Question: The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Solution:
1. Determine the current date based on the given information.
   - The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday.
   - Today is the first Monday of 2019.
   - We know that the first day of the year is a Tuesday, so we can determine the day of the week for any other date in 2019.
   - To find the current date, we need to determine the number of days between the first day of the year and today.
   - Since the first day of the year is a Tuesday and today is the first Monday, there are 6 days between them.
   - Therefore, the current date is 6 days after the first day of the year.

2. Calculate the number of hours or days given in the question.
   - The question does not specify any number of hours or days.

3. Determine if the time period given is in the past or future.
   - The question does not specify a time period.

4. Adjust the current date based on the time period and direction (past or future).
   - Since there is no time period given, we do not need to adjust the current date.

5. Convert the adjusted date to the required format (MM/DD/YYYY) as specified in the question.
   - The current date is 6 days after the first day of the year, which is January 1, 2019.
   - The date format is MM/DD/YYYY, so the current date is 01/07/2019.

Answer: The answer is 01/07/2019.



Question: The concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943, but was delayed by one day to today. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
