Question: Yes or no: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?
Solution: To answer this question, we need to break it down into smaller steps:
1. College commencements typically occur in late spring or early summer.
2. During this time of year, the weather is generally mild to warm in most regions.
3. However, some college commencements may take place in locations or at times when the temperature can still drop below freezing at night.
4. When the temperature drops below freezing and there is moisture in the air, frost can form on surfaces.
5. Therefore, while it may not be extremely common, it is possible to see frost during some college commencements, especially those held in the early morning hours or in cooler climates.
Answer: The answer is yes.



Question: Yes or no: Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?
Solution: To answer this question, we need to break it down into smaller parts and reason through them:

1. Llamas are mammals that typically give birth to one offspring at a time.
2. The gestation period for llamas is around 11-12 months.
3. The War in Vietnam (1945-46) lasted for around 1 year.

Given these facts, it would be highly unlikely for a llama to give birth twice during the short span of the War in Vietnam (1945-46). The gestation period for llamas is longer than the duration of the war, making it impossible for a single llama to have two separate pregnancies and births within that timeframe.

Answer: The answer is no.



Question: Yes or no: Would a pear sink in water?
Solution: To determine whether a pear would sink or float in water, we need to consider its density relative to the density of water. Objects with a density greater than water (around 1 g/cm³) will sink, while objects with a lower density will float.

The density of a pear is typically lower than that of water, ranging from around 0.6 to 0.8 g/cm³. This is because pears are composed mainly of water and have a relatively low mass compared to their volume.

Therefore, based on the lower density of pears compared to water, a pear would float when placed in water.
Answer: The answer is no.
