Strategy:
Here's a general multi-hop strategy to solve the task of answering yes/no questions involving multiple pieces of information:

1. Analyze the question and identify the key components or entities mentioned in it.
2. Break down the question into smaller sub-questions or sub-tasks that need to be addressed to answer the main question.
3. For each sub-question or sub-task:
    a. Retrieve relevant factual information from your knowledge base or external sources.
    b. Apply logical reasoning and inference to combine the retrieved information.
4. Based on the combined information and reasoning, determine whether the main question should be answered with "yes" or "no."
5. Provide the final answer ("yes" or "no") to the original question.

This strategy involves breaking down the complex question into smaller, more manageable pieces, gathering relevant information, applying logical reasoning, and then combining the results to arrive at the final answer. The specific details of the task are abstracted away, making the strategy generalizable to various types of yes/no questions that require multi-hop reasoning.

Examples:

2. Break down the question into smaller sub-questions or sub-tasks that need to be addressed to answer the main question.
   Sub-tasks:
   a. Determine if hamsters are prey for any predators.
   b. Identify animals that prey on hamsters.

3. For each sub-question or sub-task:
   a. Retrieve relevant factual information from your knowledge base or external sources.
      Hamsters are small rodents that are commonly kept as pets. They are prey animals and can be hunted by various predators, such as cats, snakes, owls, and other birds of prey.

   b. Apply logical reasoning and inference to combine the retrieved information.
      If hamsters are prey animals, it means that they serve as food for their predators. Therefore, hamsters provide food for certain animals that prey on them.

4. Based on the combined information and reasoning, determine whether the main question should be answered with "yes" or "no."
   The information gathered indicates that hamsters do provide food for some animals that prey on them, such as cats, snakes, owls, and birds of prey.
