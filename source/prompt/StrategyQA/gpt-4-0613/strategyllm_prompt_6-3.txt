Examples:
Question: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?

Solution: 
1. The main subject of the question is 'hamsters'.
2. The predicate of the question is 'provide food for any animals'.
3. There is no additional context provided in the question related to the time or place.
4. The question does not involve numerical information, so no computation is required.

7. As no numerical information or computation is required, this step is not applicable.
8. The compiled answer is in the form of a yes/no.
9. The answer is based on factual and verifiable information about the natural food chain.
10. The final answer is 'yes'.

Answer: The answer is yes.

2. The predicate of the question is "succeed at University of Pennsylvania".
3. There is no additional context provided in the question related to the time or place.
4. The question does not involve numerical information and no computation is required.
5. Researching information about Brooke Shields, it is found that she is a well-known actress and model. Further research reveals that she is also a graduate of Princeton University, indicating that she has a strong academic background.
6. Using this information, it can be inferred that Brooke Shields could potentially succeed at the University of Pennsylvania, given her previous academic success at a similarly prestigious institution.
7. As there is no numerical information or computation required, this step is not applicable.
8. The compiled answer follows the yes or no format.
9. The answer is based on factual and verifiable information, as Brooke Shields' academic background is well-documented.
10. The final answer is yes, Brooke Shields could succeed at the University of Pennsylvania.

Answer: The answer is yes.



Question: Yes or no: Hydrogen's atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?

Solution: 
1. The main subject of the question is Hydrogen's atomic number and the number of Spice Girls.
2. The predicate of the question is whether the square of Hydrogen's atomic number exceeds the number of Spice Girls.
3. There is no additional context provided in the question related to the time or place.
4. The question involves numerical information and computation is required.
5. Research information about the main subject: Hydrogen's atomic number is 1 and the number of Spice Girls is 5.
6. Use the information from research to answer the predicate of the question: The square of Hydrogen's atomic number (1*1=1) does not exceed the number of Spice Girls (5).
7. The computation is done accordingly and the result is that the square of Hydrogen's atomic number does not exceed the number of Spice Girls.
8. The compiled answer follows the yes or no format only.
9. The answer is based on factual and verifiable information.
10. The final answer is no.

Answer: The answer is no.



Question: Yes or no: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?

Solution: 
1. The main subject of the question is 'frost'.
2. The predicate of the question is 'is it common to see during some college commencements'.
3. The additional context provided in the question is 'college commencements'.
4. The question does not involve numerical information, so no computation is required.
5. Researching information about 'frost' and 'college commencements', we find that college commencements often occur in late spring or early summer, but some colleges, especially those on a trimester system or in colder climates, have commencements in the fall or winter when frost is common.
6. Using this information, we can answer the predicate of the question: yes, it is common to see frost during some college commencements.
7. No numerical information or computation is required for this question.
8. The compiled answer follows the yes or no format: yes.
9. The answer is based on factual and verifiable information about the timing of college commencements and the occurrence of frost.
10. The final answer is yes.

Answer: The answer is yes.



Question: Yes or no: Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?

Solution: 
1. The main subject of the question is a llama.
2. The predicate of the question is whether a llama could birth twice during a specific time period.
3. The additional context provided in the question is the War in Vietnam (1945-46).
4. The question does not involve numerical information that requires computation.
5. Researching information about llamas, it is found that the gestation period for a llama is typically around 11.5 months, but can range from 9 to 12 months.
6. Given the gestation period of a llama, it would not be possible for a llama to give birth twice within the span of the War in Vietnam (1945-46), which lasted for approximately 1 year.
7. No numerical computation is required in this case.
8. The answer is in the form of a yes/no.
9. The information used to answer the question is factual and verifiable.
10. Therefore, the final answer is no.

Answer: The answer is no.



Question: Yes or no: Would a pear sink in water?

Solution: 
1. The main subject of the question is a 'pear'.
2. The predicate of the question is 'would sink in water'.
3. There is no additional context provided in the question related to the time or place.
4. The question does not involve numerical information and no computation is required.
5. Researching information about the main subject, a pear, reveals that it is a type of fruit. There is no additional context like time or place to consider.
6. Using the information from research, we know that a pear, like most fruits, is less dense than water. This means it would not sink in water, answering the predicate of the question.
7. As there is no numerical information or computation required, we can skip this step.
8. The compiled answer is 'no', which follows the yes or no format of the question.
9. The answer is based on factual and verifiable information about the density of pears and water.
10. The final answer is 'no'.

Answer: The answer is no.
