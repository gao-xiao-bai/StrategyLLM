Strategy:
Here is the revised strategy for multi-hop question answering:

1. **Text Retrieval**: Use a neural network-based text retrieval algorithm to retrieve the most relevant text passage from the given text corpus.

2. **Question Analysis**: Develop a more advanced question analysis algorithm that can handle complex questions with multiple entities, relationships, and nuances. This algorithm should be able to identify the required information and extract relevant keywords, entities, and relationships.

3. **Target Entity Identification**: Identify multiple entities and relationships between entities, and use this information to answer the question.

4. **Pattern Matching**: Develop a more advanced pattern matching algorithm that can handle complex question patterns and answer types. This algorithm should be able to identify the expected answer type and determine the necessary information to answer the question.

5. **Argument Retrieval**: Retrieve arguments for relational questions, and use this information to answer the question.

6. **Reasoning and Calculation**: Develop a more advanced reasoning and calculation algorithm that can handle complex logical deductions and numerical calculations. This algorithm should be able to perform any necessary reasoning or calculation to arrive at the answer.

7. **Answer Generation**: Generate the final answer based on the retrieved information and the results of the reasoning and calculation steps.

8. **Post-processing**: Perform post-processing, such as filtering, ranking, or merging, to produce the final answer.

9. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the strategy on a larger and more diverse dataset to identify areas for improvement.

Additionally, consider the following general suggestions:

1. **Use a more diverse and comprehensive text corpus**: Use a more diverse and comprehensive text corpus to improve the quality of the retrieved text passages.

2. **Use a more advanced natural language processing (NLP) library**: Use a more advanced NLP library, such as spaCy or Stanford CoreNLP, to improve the accuracy of the question analysis and pattern matching steps.

3. **Use a more advanced machine learning algorithm**: Use a more advanced machine learning algorithm, such as a neural network or a decision tree, to improve the accuracy of the strategy.

By addressing the limitations and suggestions, the revised strategy should be able to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the multi-hop question answering task.
