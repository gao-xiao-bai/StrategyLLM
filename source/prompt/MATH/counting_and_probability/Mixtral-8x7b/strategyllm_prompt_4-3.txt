Examples:
Question: The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
1. Understand the problem:
   We need to find the probability of forming an odd four-digit number using the given digits. An odd number has an odd sum of digits.

2. Define the problem:
   Let's define the sample space as the total number of ways to arrange the four digits. The favorable outcomes are the arrangements that result in an odd number.

3. Identify applicable formulas or techniques:
   We will use permutations to calculate the sample space and favorable outcomes.

4. Calculate the sample space:
   The total number of ways to arrange four digits is 4!, or 4*3*2*1 = 24.

5. Calculate the favorable outcomes:
   For a number to be odd, its unit digit must be odd (i.e., 5 or 7). There are two cases:
   a) The unit digit is 5: In this case, the remaining three digits must be 2, 3, and 7 in some order. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them.
   b) The unit digit is 7: In this case, the remaining three digits must be 2, 3, and 5 in some order. Again, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them.
   Therefore, there are 6 (from case a) + 6 (from case b) = 12 favorable outcomes.

6. Compute the probability:
   The probability is 12 (favorable outcomes) / 24 (sample space) = 1/2.

7. Verify your answer:
   The answer is a simple common fraction, which is reasonable for this type of problem.

8. Check for complementary probabilities:
   The complementary probability is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2, which is the same as the original answer.

9. Consider symmetries and orientations:
   This problem does not involve symmetrical objects, so we don't need to consider additional techniques.

10. Be careful with invalid outcomes:
   There are no invalid outcomes in this problem.

Answer: The answer is 1/2.



Question: Eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color, are used to construct a regular octahedron. How many distinguishable ways are there to construct the octahedron? (Two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.)

Solution:
1. Understand the problem: We need to find the number of unique ways to color a regular octahedron using eight different colors for its faces.
2. Define the problem: Let's define the sample space as the number of ways to arrange the eight colors on the octahedron's faces.
3. Identify applicable formulas or techniques: Since the octahedron has eight faces, we can use permutations to count the number of ways to arrange the colors.
4. Calculate the sample space: The sample space is the number of permutations of eight colors, which is $8!$.
5. Calculate the favorable outcomes: Since the octahedron has two sets of four symmetrically arranged faces, we can divide the total number of permutations by 4! to account for the symmetry. So, the number of favorable outcomes is $\frac{8!}{4!}$.
6. Compute the probability: The probability is equal to the number of favorable outcomes, so it is $\frac{8!}{4!}$.
7. Verify your answer: The answer is in the form of a factorial, which is typical for counting problems.
8. Check for complementary probabilities: Complementary probabilities are not applicable here.
9. Consider symmetries and orientations: We have already accounted for the symmetries in our calculation.
10. Be careful with invalid outcomes: There are no invalid outcomes in this problem.

Answer: The answer is 1680.



Question: Given that $\binom{17}{7}=19448$, $\binom{17}{8}=24310$ and $\binom{17}{9}=24310$, calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.

Solution:
1. Understand the problem:
   We are given the values of three combinations and asked to find the value of another combination. The combinations involve choosing a certain number of elements from a set of 17 or 19 elements.

2. Define the problem:
   We need to find the number of ways to choose 9 elements from a set of 19 elements.

3. Identify applicable formulas or techniques:
   We will use the combination formula: $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n$ is the total number of elements, and $k$ is the number of elements to choose.

4. Calculate the sample space:
   Since the sample space is not relevant in this case (we are not looking for probabilities), we can skip this step.

5. Calculate the favorable outcomes:
   We will calculate $\binom{19}{9}$ using the combination formula:

   $\binom{19}{9} = \frac{19!}{9!(19-9)!} = \frac{19!}{9!10!}$

6. Compute the probability:
   As mentioned before, we are not looking for probabilities, so we can skip this step.

7. Verify your answer:
   We can verify our answer by simplifying the expression:

   $\binom{19}{9} = \frac{19 \times 18 \times 17 \times 16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10!}{9! \times 10!}$

   The $10!$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:

   $\binom{19}{9} = \frac{19 \times 18 \times 17 \times 16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11}{9!}$

8. Check for complementary probabilities:
   Since we are not looking for probabilities, we can skip this step.

9. Consider symmetries and orientations:
   Since there are no symmetrical objects involved, we can skip this step.

10. Be careful with invalid outcomes:
    Since there are no invalid outcomes, we can skip this step.

Now, we need to compute the simplified expression for $\binom{19}{9}$. However, since the actual value of the combination is required, we will calculate the numerical value using the given expression:

$\binom{19}{9} = \frac{19 \times 18 \times 17 \times 16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11}{9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}$

$\binom{19}{9} = \frac{19 \times 18 \times 17 \times 16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11}{38 \times 315}$

$\binom{19}{9} = \frac{19 \times 18 \times 17 \times 16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11}{5745}$

Calculating the result, we get:

$\binom{19}{9} = 92378$

Answer: The answer is 92378.
