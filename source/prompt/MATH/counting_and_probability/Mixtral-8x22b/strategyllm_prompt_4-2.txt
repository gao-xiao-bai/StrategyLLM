Strategy:
1. Read and understand the problem: This includes identifying the type of problem to be solved, such as combinatorics, probability, permutations, or combinations. Pay special attention to any constraints or special conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the total number of possible outcomes: Determine the total number of ways the given objects, digits, or elements can be arranged or chosen, according to the problem's requirement and without considering any special conditions.
3. Determine the favorable outcomes: Identify the number of ways that satisfy the problem's conditions. This may involve applying principles such as multiplication, permutations, combinations, or restrictions on arrangements.
4. Calculate the requested probability or count: For probability problems, divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes to find the probability. For counting problems, provide the number of favorable outcomes, or follow any additional instructions mentioned in the question.
5. Double-check the answer: Review the problem and check if the calculated result makes sense. Consider edge cases or alternative approaches to verify the accuracy of the answer.
6. Write out the final answer: Based on the problem and the calculated result, present the final answer in the appropriate format. Format answers as requested, such as fractions, decimals, or as a specific option in multiple-choice problems.

Examples:
Question: The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
1. The problem is a probability problem involving permutations of digits to form a four-digit number. The special condition is that the number must be odd.
2. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to arrange the four digits 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since there are no repeated digits, this is a permutation of 4 items taken 4 at a time, which is calculated as 4! (4 factorial).
   Calculation: 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
3. The favorable outcomes are the arrangements that result in an odd number. For a number to be odd, its last digit must be odd. In this case, the odd digits are 3, 5, and 7. So, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the remaining three digits (including the even digit 2) in the first three positions and then place one of the odd digits in the last position. This is a permutation of 3 items taken 3 at a time, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the last digit (which is 3, as there are 3 odd digits).
   Calculation: 3! (permutations of the first three digits) × 3 (choices for the last digit) = 3 × 2 × 1 × 3 = 18
4. The probability that the number is odd is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   Calculation: Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 18 / 24
5. Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms: 18 ÷ 6 = 3 and 24 ÷ 6 = 4, so the probability is 3/4.
6. The final answer is expressed as a common fraction: The answer is \frac{3}{4}

Answer: The answer is \frac{3}{4}



Question: Eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color, are used to construct a regular octahedron. How many distinguishable ways are there to construct the octahedron? (Two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.)

Solution:
1. Read and understand the problem: This is a counting problem involving the construction of a regular octahedron using eight equilateral triangles of different colors. The goal is to find the number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron, where two octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look like the other.
2. Identify the total number of possible outcomes: The total number of ways to arrange the eight triangles is the number of permutations of eight distinct objects, which is 8! (8 factorial). However, since the octahedron has rotational symmetry, we need to account for overcounting.
3. Determine the favorable outcomes: To find the number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of ways the octahedron can be rotated to look the same. The octahedron has 24 rotational symmetries (4 axes of 3-fold symmetry and 3 axes of 2-fold symmetry). Therefore, the number of distinguishable ways is 8! / 24.
4. Calculate the requested count: The number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron is 8! / 24 = 40320 / 24 = 1680.
5. Double-check the answer: The answer makes sense, as it is a whole number and is less than the total number of permutations of eight distinct objects.

Answer: The answer is 1680.



Question: The Gnollish language consists of 3 words, "splargh," "glumph," and "amr." In a sentence, "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph"; all other sentences are grammatically correct (including sentences with repeated words). How many valid 3-word sentences are there in Gnollish?

Solution:
1. Read and understand the problem: This is a counting problem involving permutations with a restriction. The task is to find the number of valid 3-word sentences in the Gnollish language, given that "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph."
2. Identify the total number of possible outcomes: Without any restrictions, there are 3 words, and we want to form 3-word sentences. The total number of possible sentences is the permutation of 3 items taken 3 at a time, which is 3! (3 factorial) = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6. However, since repetition is allowed, we need to consider all possible combinations with repetition, which is 3^3 = 27.
3. Determine the favorable outcomes: To find the number of valid sentences, we need to subtract the number of sentences where "splargh" comes directly before "glumph." There are 2 ways to place "splargh" and "glumph" together (SG or GS), and for each of these, there are 3 choices for the third word. So, there are 2 × 3 = 6 invalid sentences. Therefore, the number of valid sentences is the total number of sentences with repetition minus the invalid sentences, which is 27 - 6 = 21.
4. Calculate the requested count: The requested count is the number of valid 3-word sentences, which is 21.
5. Double-check the answer: The answer makes sense, as we have considered all possible combinations with repetition and subtracted the invalid sentences.

Answer: The answer is 21.



Question: Given that $\binom{17}{7}=19448$, $\binom{17}{8}=24310$ and $\binom{17}{9}=24310$, calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.

Solution:
1. Read and understand the problem: The problem involves calculating the value of a binomial coefficient using the given values of other binomial coefficients.
2. Identify the total number of possible outcomes: Not applicable in this case, as we are not dealing with a probability problem.
3. Determine the favorable outcomes: We need to find the value of $\binom{19}{9}$ using the given values of $\binom{17}{7}$, $\binom{17}{8}$, and $\binom{17}{9}$.
4. Calculate the requested probability or count: We can use the property of binomial coefficients, which states that $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$. Applying this property, we can express $\binom{19}{9}$ in terms of the given binomial coefficients:

$\binom{19}{9} = \binom{18}{8} + \binom{18}{9}$

Now, we can use the given values to find $\binom{18}{8}$ and $\binom{18}{9}$:

$\binom{18}{8} = \binom{17}{7} + \binom{17}{8} = 19448 + 24310 = 43758$

$\binom{18}{9} = \binom{17}{8} + \binom{17}{9} = 24310 + 24310 = 48620$

Now, we can find $\binom{19}{9}$:

$\binom{19}{9} = \binom{18}{8} + \binom{18}{9} = 43758 + 48620 = 92378$

5. Double-check the answer: The calculated result makes sense, as it is a positive integer and follows the expected pattern of binomial coefficients.

Answer: The answer is 92378.
