Examples:
Question: The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
1. Identify the problem type: This is a probability question.
2. Simplify the problem: To form an odd number, the last digit must be either 3 or 7.
3. Determine the appropriate counting technique or probability rule: Since the digits are arranged randomly, we can use the classical probability rule, which is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.
4. Solve the problem:
   - Total number of outcomes: Since there are 4 digits and each digit can be placed in any of the 4 positions, the total number of outcomes is 4! (4 factorial) = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.
   - Number of favorable outcomes: To form an odd number, the last digit can be either 3 or 7. Once the last digit is chosen, there are 3 remaining digits to be arranged in the first three positions. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 2 (choices for the last digit) × 3! (arrangements for the first three digits) = 2 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 12.
   - Probability: The probability that the number is odd is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which is 12/24.
5. Check the answer: The answer is reasonable because half of the digits (2 out of 4) can make the number odd, and the probability reflects this.
6. Convert the answer to the required format: The probability can be simplified to a common fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12. So, the probability is (12 ÷ 12) / (24 ÷ 12) = 1/2. However, since the question asks for the answer in the form of a common fraction, we can express 1/2 as 3/4 by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
7. Provide the final answer: The answer is \frac{3}{4}.

Answer: The answer is \frac{3}{4}.



Question: Eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color, are used to construct a regular octahedron. How many distinguishable ways are there to construct the octahedron? (Two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.)

Solution:
1. Identify the problem type: This is a counting problem.
2. Simplify the problem: The problem involves finding the number of distinguishable ways to construct a regular octahedron using eight different colored equilateral triangles.
3. Determine the appropriate counting technique: Since the order of the triangles matters (as rotations are considered), we will use the Polya Enumeration Theorem. However, for simplicity, we can use the Burnside's Lemma, which is a special case of the Polya Enumeration Theorem.
4. Solve the problem:
   - The symmetry group of the octahedron is the octahedral group, which has 24 elements.
   - We need to find the number of colorings fixed by each element of the group and then average them.
   - The identity element fixes all 8! colorings.
   - The rotations of order 4 fix 2 colorings each (since they have 2 cycles of length 4).
   - The rotations of order 3 fix 3 colorings each (since they have 1 cycle of length 3 and 1 cycle of length 1).
   - The rotations of order 2 fix 4 colorings each (since they have 4 cycles of length 2).
   - The number of distinguishable colorings is given by the average: (8! + 6*2 + 8*3 + 3*4) / 24 = 1680.
5. Check the answer: The answer is reasonable and corresponds to the problem statement.
6. Convert the answer to the required format: The answer is already in the required format.

Answer: The answer is 1680.



Question: The Gnollish language consists of 3 words, "splargh," "glumph," and "amr." In a sentence, "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph"; all other sentences are grammatically correct (including sentences with repeated words). How many valid 3-word sentences are there in Gnollish?

Solution:
1. Identify the problem type: This is a counting problem.
2. Simplify the problem: We need to find the number of valid 3-word sentences in Gnollish, given that "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph."
3. Determine the appropriate counting technique: Since the order of words matters, we will use permutations. However, we need to exclude the cases where "splargh" comes directly before "glumph."
4. Solve the problem:
   - First, let's find the total number of 3-word sentences without any restrictions. Since there are 3 words and order matters, we have 3 choices for the first word, 3 choices for the second word, and 3 choices for the third word. So, the total number of sentences is 3 * 3 * 3 = 27.
   - Now, let's find the number of sentences where "splargh" comes directly before "glumph." There are 2 positions where "splargh" can be placed (first or second), and for each of these positions, there is only 1 choice for the next word ("glumph"). After placing "splargh" and "glumph," there are 3 choices for the remaining word. So, the number of sentences where "splargh" comes directly before "glumph" is 2 * 1 * 3 = 6.
   - Finally, we subtract the number of invalid sentences from the total number of sentences to find the number of valid sentences: 27 - 6 = 21.
5. Check the answer: The answer is reasonable and corresponds to the problem statement.
6. Convert the answer to the required format: The answer is already in the required format.

Answer: The answer is 21.



Question: Given that $\binom{17}{7}=19448$, $\binom{17}{8}=24310$ and $\binom{17}{9}=24310$, calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.

Solution:
1. Identify the problem type: This is a counting problem involving combinations.
2. Simplify the problem: The problem asks for the calculation of $\binom{19}{9}$.
3. Determine the appropriate counting technique or probability rule: Use the combination formula and the given values to find the solution.
4. Solve the problem:
   - We know that $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$.
   - Therefore, $\binom{19}{9} = \binom{19}{10}$.
   - We can express $\binom{19}{10}$ as a sum of combinations: $\binom{19}{10} = \binom{18}{9} + \binom{18}{10}$.
   - Since $\binom{18}{10} = \binom{18}{8}$, we can rewrite the equation as $\binom{19}{10} = \binom{18}{9} + \binom{18}{8}$.
   - We can further break down $\binom{18}{9}$ and $\binom{18}{8}$ using the same technique:
     - $\binom{18}{9} = \binom{17}{9} + \binom{17}{8}$
     - $\binom{18}{8} = \binom{17}{8} + \binom{17}{7}$
   - Substituting the given values, we get:
     - $\binom{19}{10} = (24310 + 24310) + (24310 + 19448)$
     - $\binom{19}{10} = 48620 + 43758$
     - $\binom{19}{10} = 92378$
5. Check the answer: The answer is reasonable and corresponds to the problem statement.
6. Convert the answer to the required format: The answer is already in the required format.
7. Provide the final answer: The answer is 92378.

Answer: The answer is 92378.
