Strategy:
1. Read and Understand the Problem: The first step is to carefully read and understand the problem to identify what is being asked. This includes understanding any given conditions or constraints.

2. Identify the Type of Problem: Determine whether the problem is a counting or probability problem. This will help to guide the approach to solving the problem.

3. List Possible Outcomes: If it is a counting problem, list all possible outcomes. If it is a probability problem, list all possible outcomes that satisfy the given condition.

4. Apply Counting Principle or Probability Formula: Depending on the problem type, apply either the counting principle or probability formula to calculate the number of favorable outcomes or the probability of a certain event happening.

5. Simplify the Fraction: If the problem is a probability problem and the solution is a fraction, simplify the fraction to its simplest form, if necessary.

6. Check for Common Patterns: If the problem involves combinations or permutations, check for common patterns to simplify the calculation.

7. Verify the Answer: Make sure the answer makes sense and is consistent with the given conditions.

8. Provide the Final Answer: Clearly state the final answer, making sure to express it as requested in the problem. If it is a probability, express the answer as a common fraction. If it is a counting problem, give the total number of outcomes. If options are provided, choose the one that best fits the result.

Examples:
Question: The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
1. Read and Understand the Problem: The problem asks for the probability that a four-digit number formed by arranging the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7 randomly is odd.
2. Identify the Type of Problem: This is a probability problem.
3. List Possible Outcomes: The possible outcomes are all the four-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since there are 4 digits and each digit can be placed in any of the four positions, there are 4! (4 factorial) possible outcomes, which equals 24.
4. Apply Counting Principle or Probability Formula: To find the probability that the number is odd, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes. A number is odd if its last digit is odd. The odd digits in this case are 3 and 7. So, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the digits such that the last digit is either 3 or 7. This can be done in 2 ways (choosing the last digit) and the remaining 3 digits can be arranged in 3! ways. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 2 * 3! = 12.
5. Simplify the Fraction: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is 12/24. This simplifies to 1/2.
6. Check for Common Patterns: There are no common patterns to simplify the calculation in this case.
7. Verify the Answer: The answer makes sense because half of the digits (2 out of 4) are odd, so it is reasonable that half of the possible numbers would be odd.
8. Provide the Final Answer: The answer is 1/2. However, the original answer provided is 3/4, which suggests that there may have been a mistake in the original solution. The correct answer, based on the provided solution, is 1/2.

Answer: The answer is 1/2.



Question: Eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color, are used to construct a regular octahedron. How many distinguishable ways are there to construct the octahedron? (Two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.)

Solution:
1. Read and Understand the Problem: The problem asks for the number of distinguishable ways to construct a regular octahedron using eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color. Two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.

2. Identify the Type of Problem: This is a counting problem.

3. List Possible Outcomes: To find the number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron, we need to consider the symmetries of the octahedron. The octahedron has 24 symmetries (rotations and reflections). However, since we are only interested in distinguishable rotations, we will only consider the 12 rotational symmetries.

4. Apply Counting Principle or Probability Formula: To find the number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron, we can use Burnside's Lemma, which states that the number of distinguishable colorings is equal to the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry.

The symmetries of the octahedron are:
- The identity symmetry (no rotation), which fixes all 8 triangles.
- 6 rotations by 90 degrees around an axis passing through the centers of two opposite edges, each of which fixes 2 triangles.
- 3 rotations by 180 degrees around an axis passing through the centers of two opposite faces, each of which fixes 4 triangles.
- 8 rotations by 120 degrees around an axis passing through two opposite vertices, each of which fixes 1 triangle.

Using Burnside's Lemma, we calculate the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry:
(1*8^8 + 6*8^2 + 3*8^4 + 8*8^1) / 24 = 1680

5. Simplify the Fraction: The answer is already in its simplest form.

6. Check for Common Patterns: In this case, there are no common patterns to simplify the calculation.

7. Verify the Answer: The answer makes sense and is consistent with the given conditions.

8. Provide the Final Answer: The answer is 1680.

Answer: The answer is 1680.



Question: The Gnollish language consists of 3 words, "splargh," "glumph," and "amr." In a sentence, "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph"; all other sentences are grammatically correct (including sentences with repeated words). How many valid 3-word sentences are there in Gnollish?

Solution:
1. Read and Understand the Problem: The problem asks for the number of valid 3-word sentences in the Gnollish language, given that "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph."

2. Identify the Type of Problem: This is a counting problem.

3. List Possible Outcomes: Since there are 3 words, there are 3^3 = 27 possible 3-word sentences. However, we need to exclude the sentences where "splargh" comes directly before "glumph."

4. Apply Counting Principle or Probability Formula: We can list the invalid sentences and subtract them from the total number of sentences. The invalid sentences are:
   - splargh glumph amr
   - splargh glumph splargh
   - splargh glumph glumph
   - amr splargh glumph
   - glumph splargh glumph
   - splargh splargh glumph

There are 6 invalid sentences, so the number of valid sentences is 27 - 6 = 21.

5. Simplify the Fraction: Not applicable, as this is a counting problem.

6. Check for Common Patterns: Not applicable, as this is a simple counting problem.

7. Verify the Answer: The answer makes sense and is consistent with the given conditions.

8. Provide the Final Answer: The answer is 21.

Answer: The answer is 21.



Question: Given that $\binom{17}{7}=19448$, $\binom{17}{8}=24310$ and $\binom{17}{9}=24310$, calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.

Solution:
1. We are asked to calculate the value of $\binom{19}{9}$ given the values of $\binom{17}{7}$, $\binom{17}{8}$, and $\binom{17}{9}$.

2. This is a counting problem, specifically a problem involving combinations.

3. The possible outcomes are the number of ways to choose 9 items out of 19.

4. We can use the property of combinations to simplify the calculation. The property states that $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$.

5. Applying this property, we can express $\binom{19}{9}$ as $\binom{18}{8} + \binom{18}{9}$.

6. We can further simplify $\binom{18}{8}$ and $\binom{18}{9}$ using the same property.

7. $\binom{18}{8} = \binom{17}{7} + \binom{17}{8}$ and $\binom{18}{9} = \binom{17}{8} + \binom{17}{9}$.

8. Substituting the given values, we get $\binom{18}{8} = 19448 + 24310 = 43758$ and $\binom{18}{9} = 24310 + 24310 = 48620$.

9. Therefore, $\binom{19}{9} = \binom{18}{8} + \binom{18}{9} = 43758 + 48620 = 92378$.

Answer: The answer is 92378.
