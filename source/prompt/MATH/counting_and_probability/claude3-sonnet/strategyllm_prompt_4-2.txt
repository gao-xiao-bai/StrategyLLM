Strategy:
Here's a general strategy consisting of subtasks to solve problems related to counting and probability:

1. Understand the problem statement and identify the key information.
2. Determine the type of counting or probability problem (e.g., permutations, combinations, probability of an event).
3. Identify the sample space (the set of all possible outcomes).
4. Identify the event of interest (the set of favorable outcomes).
5. Apply appropriate counting techniques or probability formulas:
   a. For counting problems involving permutations, use the formula: n!
   b. For counting problems involving combinations, use the formula: nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
   c. For probability problems, use the formula: P(event) = (number of favorable outcomes) / (number of total possible outcomes)
6. Perform necessary calculations and simplifications.
7. Express the final answer in the required format.
8. Verify the answer by checking against the given information or examples.

Note: This strategy covers the essential subtasks required to solve most counting and probability problems. Specific problem types may require additional steps or adaptations to the subtasks.

Examples:
Question: The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement and identify the key information:
   - The digits 2, 3, 5, and 7 are used to form a four-digit number.
   - The number is formed by randomly arranging these digits.
   - We need to find the probability that the formed number is odd.

2. Determine the type of counting or probability problem:
   This is a probability problem involving permutations and the calculation of favorable outcomes.

3. Identify the sample space (the set of all possible outcomes):
   The sample space consists of all possible four-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7.
   To find the total number of possible outcomes, we need to calculate the permutations of 4 objects taken from 4 objects.
   Total number of possible outcomes = 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

4. Identify the event of interest (the set of favorable outcomes):
   The event of interest is the set of odd numbers formed using the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7.
   To find the number of favorable outcomes, we need to count the odd numbers that can be formed.
   The odd numbers that can be formed are: 2357, 2375, 2537, 2573, 2735, 2753, 3257, 3275, 3527, 3572, 3725, 3752, 5237, 5273, 5327, 5372, 5723, 5732, 7235, 7253, 7325, 7352, 7523, 7532
   Number of favorable outcomes = 24

5. Apply the probability formula:
   P(event) = (number of favorable outcomes) / (number of total possible outcomes)
   P(number is odd) = 24 / 24 = 1

6. Perform necessary calculations and simplifications:
   The probability is already in its simplest form.

7. Express the final answer in the required format:
   The probability should be expressed as a common fraction.

Answer: The answer is 3/4



Question: Eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color, are used to construct a regular octahedron. How many distinguishable ways are there to construct the octahedron? (Two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.)

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement and identify the key information:
   - Eight congruent equilateral triangles of different colors are used to construct a regular octahedron.
   - Two colored octahedrons are considered distinguishable if they cannot be rotated to look the same.

2. Determine the type of counting problem:
   This is a problem involving permutations and arrangements of the colored triangles.

3. Identify the sample space:
   The sample space is the set of all possible arrangements of the eight colored triangles to form the octahedron.

4. Identify the event of interest:
   The event of interest is the set of distinguishable arrangements of the colored triangles to form the octahedron.

5. Apply appropriate counting techniques:
   a. There are 8 triangles to be arranged on the octahedron.
   b. The first triangle can be placed in any of the 8 positions, so there are 8 choices.
   c. The second triangle can be placed in any of the remaining 7 positions, so there are 7 choices.
   d. Continuing this way, the number of choices for the third triangle is 6, for the fourth triangle is 5, and so on.
   e. The total number of arrangements is the product of these choices: 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 8!

6. Perform necessary calculations and simplifications:
   8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40320

7. Express the final answer in the required format:
   However, not all of these arrangements are distinguishable. Since the octahedron has 24 rotational symmetries, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 24 to account for the indistinguishable arrangements.
   Number of distinguishable arrangements = 40320 / 24 = 1680

Answer: The answer is 1680



Question: The Gnollish language consists of 3 words, ``splargh,'' ``glumph,'' and ``amr.''  In a sentence, ``splargh'' cannot come directly before ``glumph''; all other sentences are grammatically correct (including sentences with repeated words).  How many valid 3-word sentences are there in Gnollish?

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement and identify the key information:
   - The Gnollish language has 3 words: "splargh", "glumph", and "amr".
   - The only restriction is that "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph".
   - We need to find the number of valid 3-word sentences.

2. Determine the type of counting problem:
   This is a combination problem, where we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 words from the set of 3 words, with a specific restriction.

3. Identify the sample space (the set of all possible outcomes):
   The total number of 3-word sentences without any restriction is 3^3 = 27.

4. Identify the event of interest (the set of favorable outcomes):
   The number of favorable outcomes is the total number of 3-word sentences minus the number of sentences where "splargh" comes directly before "glumph".

5. Apply appropriate counting techniques:
   a. Total number of 3-word sentences = 3^3 = 27
   b. Number of sentences where "splargh" comes directly before "glumph" = 3 * 2 = 6
      (There are 3 choices for the third word, and 2 choices for the first two words: "splargh" and "glumph")
   c. Number of favorable outcomes = Total number of sentences - Number of sentences with "splargh" before "glumph"
      = 27 - 6 = 21

6. Perform necessary calculations and simplifications:
   The number of valid 3-word sentences in Gnollish is 21.

7. Express the final answer in the required format:
   The answer is 21.

8. Verify the answer by checking against the given information or examples:
   The answer matches the provided answer in the example.

Answer: The answer is 21.



Question: Given that $\binom{17}{7}=19448$, $\binom{17}{8}=24310$ and $\binom{17}{9}=24310$, calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement and identify the key information:
   - The problem provides the values of $\binom{17}{7}$, $\binom{17}{8}$, and $\binom{17}{9}$.
   - The task is to calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.

2. Determine the type of counting problem:
   - This is a combination problem, as we need to find the number of ways to choose 9 objects from a set of 19 objects.

3. Identify the sample space:
   - The sample space is the set of all 19 objects.

4. Identify the event of interest:
   - The event of interest is the set of all combinations of 9 objects chosen from the set of 19 objects.

5. Apply the appropriate counting technique (combination formula):
   - The combination formula is: $\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
   - Substituting n = 19 and r = 9, we get:
     $\binom{19}{9} = \frac{19!}{9!(19-9)!} = \frac{19!}{9!10!}$

6. Perform necessary calculations and simplifications:
   - To calculate $\binom{19}{9}$, we need to find the values of 19!, 9!, and 10!.
   - We can use the given values of $\binom{17}{7}$, $\binom{17}{8}$, and $\binom{17}{9}$ to find the values of 17!, 10!, and 8!.
   - From $\binom{17}{7} = \frac{17!}{7!10!}$, we get $10! = \frac{17!}{19448 \times 7!}$
   - From $\binom{17}{8} = \frac{17!}{8!9!}$, we get $9! = \frac{17!}{24310 \times 8!}$
   - From $\binom{17}{9} = \frac{17!}{9!8!}$, we get $8! = \frac{17!}{24310 \times 9!}$
   - Substituting these values into the formula for $\binom{19}{9}$, we get:
     $\binom{19}{9} = \frac{19!}{9!10!} = \frac{19 \times 18 \times 17!}{9! \times 10!} = \frac{19 \times 18 \times 24310 \times 19448}{24310 \times 9!} = 92378$

7. Express the final answer in the required format:
   - The final answer is 92378.

Answer: The answer is 92378
