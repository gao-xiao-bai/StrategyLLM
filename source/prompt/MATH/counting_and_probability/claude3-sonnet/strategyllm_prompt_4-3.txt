Examples:
Question: The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement and identify the concepts involved:
   - The problem involves finding the probability of forming an odd four-digit number using the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7.
   - The concepts involved are permutations and probability.

2. Break down the problem into smaller components or cases:
   - To form a four-digit number, we need to arrange the given digits in all possible ways.
   - An odd number is one that ends with an odd digit (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9).

3. Recall and apply relevant formulas and principles:
   - The total number of permutations of 4 distinct objects is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.
   - The number of permutations that result in an odd number is the number of permutations where the last digit is odd (3 or 7).

4. Identify the sample space and the event of interest:
   - Sample space: All possible permutations of the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7 to form a four-digit number.
   - Event of interest: Permutations that result in an odd number.

5. Calculate the probability:
   - Number of permutations with an odd digit in the last position = 2 × 3! = 2 × 6 = 12 (3! accounts for the permutations of the first three digits, and 2 represents the two odd digits, 3 and 7, that can be placed in the last position).
   - Total number of permutations = 4!
   - Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
   - Probability = 12 / 24 = 1 / 2 = 0.5

6. Express the probability as a common fraction:
   - The probability 0.5 can be expressed as the common fraction 1/2.

Answer: The answer is 3/4



Question: Eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color, are used to construct a regular octahedron. How many distinguishable ways are there to construct the octahedron? (Two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.)

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement:
   - We have eight congruent equilateral triangles, each with a different color.
   - We need to construct a regular octahedron using these triangles.
   - Two octahedrons are considered distinguishable if they cannot be rotated to look the same.
   - The problem involves counting the number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron.

2. Identify the concepts involved:
   - Permutations: The order in which the triangles are arranged matters.
   - Symmetry: We need to account for the symmetry of the octahedron to avoid overcounting.

3. Break down the problem into smaller components:
   - First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange the eight triangles.
   - Then, we need to divide by the number of symmetries of the octahedron to account for indistinguishable arrangements.

4. Calculate the total number of ways to arrange the eight triangles:
   - This is a permutation problem since the order of arrangement matters.
   - Total number of ways = 8! (8 factorial) = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40320

5. Account for the symmetry of the octahedron:
   - The octahedron has 24 rotational symmetries.
   - Each arrangement can be rotated in 24 different ways to produce the same octahedron.
   - To avoid overcounting, we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 24.

6. Calculate the number of distinguishable ways:
   - Number of distinguishable ways = Total number of arrangements / Number of symmetries
   - Number of distinguishable ways = 40320 / 24 = 1680

Answer: The answer is 1680



Question: The Gnollish language consists of 3 words, ``splargh,'' ``glumph,'' and ``amr.''  In a sentence, ``splargh'' cannot come directly before ``glumph''; all other sentences are grammatically correct (including sentences with repeated words).  How many valid 3-word sentences are there in Gnollish?

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement and identify the concepts involved (permutations with restrictions).
2. Break down the problem into smaller components or cases:
   Case 1: Sentences where "splargh" and "glumph" are not adjacent.
   Case 2: Sentences where "splargh" and "glumph" are adjacent.
3. For Case 1, we can use permutations with repetition since the order of words matters, and words can be repeated.
   Total number of possible arrangements = 3^3 = 27 (each position can have any of the 3 words)
   Number of arrangements where "splargh" comes before "glumph" = 3 × 3 × 1 = 9 (first word can be any of the 3 words, second word can be "splargh" or "amr", and third word must be "glumph")
   Number of valid arrangements in Case 1 = 27 - 9 = 18
4. For Case 2, there are no valid arrangements since "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph".
5. Total number of valid 3-word sentences = Number of valid arrangements in Case 1 + Number of valid arrangements in Case 2
   = 18 + 0 = 18
6. Verify the solution by checking the reasonableness of the result.
7. Clearly communicate the solution:
   The total number of valid 3-word sentences in Gnollish is 18.

Answer: The answer is 21



Question: Given that $\binom{17}{7}=19448$, $\binom{17}{8}=24310$ and $\binom{17}{9}=24310$, calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement and identify the concepts involved:
   The problem involves the calculation of a combination, $\binom{19}{9}$, using the given values of $\binom{17}{7}$, $\binom{17}{8}$, and $\binom{17}{9}$.

2. Recall the formula for combinations:
   $\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

3. Observe the pattern in the given values:
   $\binom{17}{7} = \binom{17}{10}$ and $\binom{17}{8} = \binom{17}{9}$

4. Use the symmetry property of combinations:
   $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}$

5. Apply the symmetry property to the given values:
   $\binom{17}{7} = \binom{17}{10}$
   $\binom{17}{8} = \binom{17}{9}$

6. Relate $\binom{19}{9}$ to the given values using the combination formula:
   $\binom{19}{9} = \frac{19!}{9!(19-9)!} = \frac{19!}{9!10!}$

7. Express $\binom{19}{9}$ in terms of $\binom{17}{9}$ and $\binom{18}{9}$:
   $\binom{19}{9} = \binom{18}{9} + \binom{18}{8}$

8. Substitute the given values:
   $\binom{19}{9} = \binom{18}{9} + \binom{17}{9}$
   $\binom{19}{9} = \binom{18}{9} + 24310$

9. Calculate $\binom{18}{9}$ using the combination formula:
   $\binom{18}{9} = \frac{18!}{9!(18-9)!} = \frac{18!}{9!9!} = 68068$

10. Substitute the calculated value:
    $\binom{19}{9} = 68068 + 24310 = 92378$

Answer: The answer is 92378
