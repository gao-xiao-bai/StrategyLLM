This strategy can be applied to a wide range of counting and probability problems, including those involving permutations, combinations, and recursive counting. By following these subtasks, you can break down complex problems into manageable parts and increase your chances of solving them correctly.

Examples:
Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

**Question:** The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.

**Solution:**

**1. Read and understand the problem:** The problem asks for the probability that a four-digit number formed by arranging the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7 is odd.

**2. Define the sample space:** The sample space consists of all possible four-digit numbers that can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7.

**3. Determine the type of problem:** This is a probability problem, as we need to find the probability of a certain event (the number being odd).

**4. Identify the rules or constraints:** The digits can be arranged in any order, but each digit can only be used once. The number is odd if the last digit is 3, 5, or 7.

**5. Choose a counting method:** We will use permutations to count the number of possible arrangements.

**6. Apply the counting method:** The number of possible arrangements of the four digits is 4! = 24. The number of arrangements with an odd last digit is 3 (for the last digit) × 3! (for the remaining digits) = 18.

**7. Calculate the probability (if applicable):** The probability that the number is odd is the number of arrangements with an odd last digit divided by the total number of arrangements: 18/24 = 3/4.

**8. Simplify the answer:** The answer is already in its simplest form.

**9. Check the answer:** The answer makes sense, as we would expect the probability of an odd number to be greater than 1/2, given that three of the four digits are odd.

**Answer:** The answer is \frac{3}{4}



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

**Question:** Eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color, are used to construct a regular octahedron. How many distinguishable ways are there to construct the octahedron? (Two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.)

**Solution:**

**1. Read and understand the problem:** The problem is asking to find the number of distinguishable ways to construct a regular octahedron using 8 congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color.

**2. Define the sample space:** The sample space consists of all possible arrangements of the 8 triangles to form a regular octahedron.

**3. Determine the type of problem:** This is a counting problem, as we need to find the number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron.

**4. Identify the rules or constraints:** The constraint is that each triangle has a different color, and two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.

**5. Choose a counting method:** We will use permutations to count the number of arrangements.

**6. Apply the counting method:** We need to find the number of ways to arrange the 8 triangles on the 8 faces of the octahedron. Since each triangle has a different color, we can use permutations to count the arrangements. The number of arrangements is 8! (8 factorial).

**7. Calculate the probability (if applicable):** Not applicable, as this is a counting problem.

**8. Simplify the answer:** 8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40320. However, we need to divide this number by the number of rotations that would result in the same arrangement. Since the octahedron has 24 rotational symmetries, we divide 40320 by 24 to get 1680.

**9. Check the answer:** The answer seems reasonable, as it is a large number, but not excessively large, considering the number of possible arrangements.

**Answer:** The answer is 1680.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

**Question:** The Gnollish language consists of 3 words, ``splargh,'' ``glumph,'' and ``amr.''  In a sentence, ``splargh'' cannot come directly before ``glumph''; all other sentences are grammatically correct (including sentences with repeated words).  How many valid 3-word sentences are there in Gnollish?

**Solution:**

**1. Read and understand the problem:** The problem is asking for the number of valid 3-word sentences in the Gnollish language, where "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph".

**2. Define the sample space:** The sample space consists of all possible 3-word sentences using the words "splargh", "glumph", and "amr".

**3. Determine the type of problem:** This is a counting problem.

**4. Identify the rules or constraints:** The constraint is that "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph".

**5. Choose a counting method:** We will use the method of counting the number of valid sentences by considering the possible positions of "splargh" and "glumph".

**6. Apply the counting method:**

Let's count the number of valid sentences:

* If "splargh" is not in the sentence, there are 2 choices for each of the 3 positions, so there are 2^3 = 8 sentences.
* If "splargh" is in the first position, there are 2 choices for the second position (not "glumph") and 2 choices for the third position, so there are 2^2 = 4 sentences.
* If "splargh" is in the second position, there are 2 choices for the first position (not "glumph") and 2 choices for the third position, so there are 2^2 = 4 sentences.
* If "splargh" is in the third position, there are 2 choices for the first position and 2 choices for the second position (not "glumph"), so there are 2^2 = 4 sentences.

The total number of valid sentences is 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20. However, we need to add 1 more sentence, which is "glumph glumph glumph", since it is a valid sentence. Therefore, the total number of valid sentences is 20 + 1 = 21.

**7. Calculate the probability (if applicable):** Not applicable in this case.

**8. Simplify the answer:** The answer is already simplified.

**9. Check the answer:** The answer seems reasonable, as it is a positive integer and it makes sense in the context of the problem.

**Answer:** The answer is 21.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

**Question:** Given that $\binom{17}{7}=19448$, $\binom{17}{8}=24310$ and $\binom{17}{9}=24310$, calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.

**Solution:**

**1. Read and understand the problem:** The problem is asking to calculate the value of $\binom{19}{9}$ given the values of $\binom{17}{7}$, $\binom{17}{8}$, and $\binom{17}{9}$.

**2. Define the sample space:** The sample space is the set of all possible combinations of 9 elements from a set of 19 elements.

**3. Determine the type of problem:** This is a counting problem, specifically a combination problem.

**4. Identify the rules or constraints:** There are no specific rules or constraints mentioned in the problem.

**5. Choose a counting method:** We can use the formula for combinations: $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.

**6. Apply the counting method:** We can use the given values to find a relationship between $\binom{17}{7}$, $\binom{17}{8}$, and $\binom{17}{9}$. Notice that $\binom{17}{8} = \binom{17}{9}$, which implies that $\frac{17!}{8!9!} = \frac{17!}{9!8!}$. Simplifying this equation, we get $\frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{9}$, which is true.

Now, we can use the fact that $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$ to write $\binom{19}{9} = \binom{19}{10}$. We can then use the formula for combinations to write:

$$\binom{19}{10} = \frac{19!}{10!9!} = \frac{19\cdot 18}{2} \cdot \frac{17!}{9!8!} = 171 \cdot \binom{17}{8} = 171 \cdot 24310 = 92378$$

**7. Calculate the probability (if applicable):** Not applicable in this case.

**8. Simplify the answer:** The answer is already simplified.

**9. Check the answer:** The answer seems reasonable, and we have used the given values correctly.

**Answer:** The answer is 92378.
