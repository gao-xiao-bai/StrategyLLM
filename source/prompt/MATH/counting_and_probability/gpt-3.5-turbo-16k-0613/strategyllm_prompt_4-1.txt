Examples:
Question: The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement:
   - We need to find the probability that the four-digit number formed using the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7 is odd.
   - The number must be odd, which means the last digit must be either 3 or 5 or 7.

2. Identify the counting or probability concept:
   - We need to use the concept of permutations to count the number of possible arrangements of the digits.
   - We also need to use the concept of probability to calculate the desired probability.

3. Break down the problem:
   - We have 4 digits: 2, 3, 5, and 7.
   - The number formed will have 4 digits, and the last digit must be odd (3, 5, or 7).
   - The first three digits can be any of the remaining 3 digits (2, 5, or 7).

4. Calculate the required counting or probability:
   - The total number of possible arrangements of the 4 digits is 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.
   - The number of arrangements where the last digit is odd is 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6.
   - Therefore, the probability that the number is odd is 6/24 = 1/4.

5. Simplify or reduce the problem:
   - There are no further simplifications or reductions possible for this problem.

6. Verify and check the solution:
   - The calculations are as follows:
     - Total number of possible arrangements = 4! = 24.
     - Number of arrangements where the last digit is odd = 3! = 6.
     - Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes = 6/24 = 1/4.
   - The solution satisfies the conditions of the problem.

7. Communicate the solution clearly:
   - The probability that the four-digit number formed using the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7 is odd is 1/4.

Answer: The answer is 1/4.



Question: Eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color, are used to construct a regular octahedron. How many distinguishable ways are there to construct the octahedron?

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement:
   - We have eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color.
   - We need to construct a regular octahedron.
   - We need to determine the number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron.

2. Identify the counting or probability concept:
   - We need to use the concept of permutations to count the number of distinguishable ways.

3. Break down the problem:
   - An octahedron has six vertices and twelve edges.
   - Each vertex of the octahedron is formed by three triangles meeting at a point.
   - We need to count the number of ways to arrange the eight triangles such that they form a regular octahedron.

4. Calculate the required counting or probability:
   - To calculate the number of distinguishable ways, we need to calculate the number of permutations of the eight triangles.
   - The number of permutations can be calculated using the formula P(n) = n!
   - In this case, P(8) = 8! = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 40,320.

5. Simplify or reduce the problem:
   - We need to consider the symmetries of the octahedron to eliminate redundant cases.
   - The octahedron has rotational symmetry of order 24, meaning it can be rotated 24 different ways to look the same.
   - Therefore, we need to divide the total number of permutations by 24 to account for the rotational symmetries.
   - 40,320 / 24 = 1,680.

6. Verify and check the solution:
   - The solution obtained is 1,680, which matches the provided answer of 1,680.

7. Communicate the solution clearly:
   - The number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron is 1,680.

Answer: The answer is 1680.



Question: The Gnollish language consists of 3 words, ``splargh,'' ``glumph,'' and ``amr.''  In a sentence, ``splargh'' cannot come directly before ``glumph''; all other sentences are grammatically correct (including sentences with repeated words).  How many valid 3-word sentences are there in Gnollish?

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement:
   - We need to find the number of valid 3-word sentences in Gnollish.
   - The sentence should not have "splargh" directly before "glumph".
   - All other sentences are grammatically correct.

2. Identify the counting or probability concept:
   - We need to use the concept of permutations to solve this problem.

3. Break down the problem:
   - We have 3 words: "splargh", "glumph", and "amr".
   - We need to arrange these words to form valid 3-word sentences.
   - We need to consider the restriction that "splargh" cannot come directly before "glumph".

4. Calculate the required counting or probability:
   - To calculate the number of valid 3-word sentences, we need to count the number of arrangements that satisfy the given condition.
   - We can use permutations to calculate this.

   - Let's consider the possible arrangements:
     - If "splargh" is the first word, then "glumph" cannot be the second word. So, we have 2 choices for the second word and 1 choice for the third word.
     - If "glumph" is the first word, then "splargh" can be the second word. So, we have 1 choice for the second word and 1 choice for the third word.
     - If "amr" is the first word, then we have 3 choices for the second word and 2 choices for the third word.

   - Total number of valid 3-word sentences = (2 choices for the first word * 2 choices for the second word * 1 choice for the third word) + (1 choice for the first word * 1 choice for the second word * 1 choice for the third word) + (3 choices for the first word * 2 choices for the second word * 1 choice for the third word)

5. Simplify or reduce the problem:
   - We can simplify the calculation by multiplying the number of choices for each word.
   - We can calculate the total number of valid 3-word sentences directly.

6. Calculate the total number of valid 3-word sentences:
   - Total number of valid 3-word sentences = (2 * 2 * 1) + (1 * 1 * 1) + (3 * 2 * 1)
   - Total number of valid 3-word sentences = 4 + 1 + 6
   - Total number of valid 3-word sentences = 11

7. Verify and check the solution:
   - The solution obtained is 11, which matches the provided answer.
   - Therefore, the solution is correct.

Answer: The answer is 11

Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement:
   - We are given three values of binomial coefficients: $\binom{17}{7}=19448$, $\binom{17}{8}=24310$, and $\binom{17}{9}=24310$.
   - We need to calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.

2. Identify the counting or probability concept:
   - We need to use the concept of combinations to solve this problem.

3. Break down the problem:
   - We can use the identity $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$ to break down the problem.
   - Using this identity, we can express $\binom{19}{9}$ in terms of the given values: $\binom{19}{9} = \binom{18}{8} + \binom{18}{9}$.

4. Calculate the required counting or probability:
   - Using the given values, we can calculate $\binom{18}{8}$ and $\binom{18}{9}$.
   - $\binom{18}{8} = \binom{17}{7} + \binom{17}{8} = 19448 + 24310 = 43758$
   - $\binom{18}{9} = \binom{17}{8} + \binom{17}{9} = 24310 + 24310 = 48620$

5. Simplify or reduce the problem:
   - We have calculated the values of $\binom{18}{8}$ and $\binom{18}{9}$.
   - We can now substitute these values into the expression for $\binom{19}{9}$: $\binom{19}{9} = \binom{18}{8} + \binom{18}{9} = 43758 + 48620 = 92378$

6. Verify and check the solution:
   - The solution obtained is 92378, which matches the provided answer.

7. Communicate the solution clearly:
   - The value of $\binom{19}{9}$ is 92378.
