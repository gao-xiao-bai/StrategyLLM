Question: The digits 2, 3, 5 and 7 are arranged randomly to form a four-digit number. What is the probability that the number is odd? Express your answer as a common fraction.
Solution: To find the probability that the number is odd, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.

Total number of possible outcomes:
Since we are arranging the digits randomly, there are 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24 possible arrangements of the digits.

Number of favorable outcomes:
For the number to be odd, the units digit must be either 3 or 7. The remaining three digits can be arranged in any order. So, there are 2 x 3! = 2 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 12 favorable outcomes.

Probability:
The probability of an event is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
           = 12 / 24
           = 1/2

Answer: The answer is 1/2



Question: Eight congruent equilateral triangles, each of a different color, are used to construct a regular octahedron. How many distinguishable ways are there to construct the octahedron? (Two colored octahedrons are distinguishable if neither can be rotated to look just like the other.)
[asy] import three; import math; unitsize(1.5cm); currentprojection=orthographic(2,0.2,1);  triple A=(0,0,1); triple B=(sqrt(2)/2,sqrt(2)/2,0); triple C=(sqrt(2)/2,-sqrt(2)/2,0); triple D=(-sqrt(2)/2,-sqrt(2)/2,0); triple E=(-sqrt(2)/2,sqrt(2)/2,0); triple F=(0,0,-1); draw(A--B--E--cycle); draw(A--C--D--cycle); draw(F--C--B--cycle); draw(F--D--E--cycle,dotted+linewidth(0.7)); [/asy]
Solution: To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps. 

Step 1: Count the number of ways to arrange the colors on one face of the octahedron. Since there are 8 different colors, there are 8 choices for the first color, 7 choices for the second color, and so on. Therefore, there are $8!$ ways to arrange the colors on one face.

Step 2: Count the number of ways to arrange the colors on the opposite face of the octahedron. Since the opposite face is a mirror image of the first face, there are only 4 choices for the first color, 3 choices for the second color, and so on. Therefore, there are $4!$ ways to arrange the colors on the opposite face.

Step 3: Count the number of ways to arrange the remaining 6 colors on the remaining 6 faces of the octahedron. Since the remaining faces are indistinguishable, we can divide the number of arrangements by $6!$ to account for the indistinguishability. Therefore, there are $\frac{6!}{6!}$ ways to arrange the remaining colors.

Step 4: Multiply the results from Steps 1, 2, and 3 to get the total number of distinguishable ways to construct the octahedron. Therefore, the total number of ways is $8! \times 4! \times \frac{6!}{6!} = 1680$.

Answer: The answer is 1680.



Question: The Gnollish language consists of 3 words, ``splargh,'' ``glumph,'' and ``amr.''  In a sentence, ``splargh'' cannot come directly before ``glumph''; all other sentences are grammatically correct (including sentences with repeated words).  How many valid 3-word sentences are there in Gnollish?
Solution: To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations. Since there are 3 words in the Gnollish language, we need to find the number of permutations of these 3 words that satisfy the given condition.

Let's consider the word "splargh" as S, "glumph" as G, and "amr" as A. We need to find the number of permutations of S, G, and A such that S does not come directly before G.

To find the total number of permutations, we can use the formula for permutations of n objects taken all at a time, which is n!.

However, we need to subtract the number of permutations where S comes directly before G. In this case, we can treat SG as a single object. So, we have 2 objects (SG and A) to arrange, which can be done in 2! = 2 ways.

Therefore, the total number of valid 3-word sentences in Gnollish is 3! - 2! = 6 - 2 = 4.

Answer: The answer is 4.



Question: Given that $\binom{17}{7}=19448$, $\binom{17}{8}=24310$ and $\binom{17}{9}=24310$, calculate $\binom{19}{9}$.
Solution: We can use the identity $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$ to solve this problem. 

Using the given values, we have $\binom{17}{8} = \binom{16}{7} + \binom{16}{8}$. Rearranging this equation, we get $\binom{16}{7} = \binom{17}{8} - \binom{16}{8}$. Substituting the given values, we have $\binom{16}{7} = 24310 - 24310 = 0$.

Similarly, we can find $\binom{16}{8}$ using the given values $\binom{17}{9} = \binom{16}{8} + \binom{16}{9}$. Rearranging this equation, we get $\binom{16}{8} = \binom{17}{9} - \binom{16}{9}$. Substituting the given values, we have $\binom{16}{8} = 24310 - 24310 = 0$.

Now, we can use the identity $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$ again to find $\binom{19}{9}$. We have $\binom{19}{9} = \binom{18}{8} + \binom{18}{9}$. Rearranging this equation, we get $\binom{18}{8} = \binom{19}{9} - \binom{18}{9}$. Substituting the values we found earlier, we have $\binom{18}{8} = 0 + 0 = 0$.

Therefore, $\binom{19}{9} = 0$.

Answer: The answer is 0.
