Question: Calculate $\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x}$ . Express your answer in simplest radical form in terms of $x$.
Solution: 
Step 1: Simplify the expression by multiplying the radicals together.
$\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x} = \sqrt{(75x)(2x)(14x)}$
Step 2: Simplify the expression inside the radical.
$\sqrt{(75x)(2x)(14x)} = \sqrt{2100x^3}$
Step 3: Simplify the radical by factoring out perfect squares.
$\sqrt{2100x^3} = \sqrt{(100x^2)(21x)}$
Step 4: Simplify the expression inside the radical.
$\sqrt{(100x^2)(21x)} = \sqrt{100x^2} \cdot \sqrt{21x}$
Step 5: Simplify the radicals.
$\sqrt{100x^2} = 10x$
Step 6: Combine the radicals.
$\sqrt{100x^2} \cdot \sqrt{21x} = 10x \cdot \sqrt{21x}$
Answer: The answer is $10x\sqrt{21x}$.



Question: Rationalize the denominator of $\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}}$. The answer can be written as $\frac{A\sqrt{B}+C}{D}$, where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are integers, $D$ is positive, and $B$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find the minimum possible value of $A+B+C+D$.

Solution:
Step 1: Simplify expressions involving radicals by multiplying and combining under a single radical if possible.
We can simplify $\sqrt{32}$ by factoring out the perfect square factor:
$\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{16} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}$

Step 2: Rationalize the denominators of fractions with radicals by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
The conjugate of $\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}$ is $\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}$.
Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate, we get:
$\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2})}{(\sqrt{16})^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}(4+\sqrt{2})}{16-2} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}(4+\sqrt{2})}{14} = \frac{16\sqrt{2}+8}{14}$

Step 3: Find the minimum possible value of $A+B+C+D$.
From the expression $\frac{16\sqrt{2}+8}{14}$, we can see that $A=16$, $B=2$, $C=8$, and $D=14$.
Therefore, the minimum possible value of $A+B+C+D$ is $16+2+8+14 = 40$.

Answer: The answer is 40.



Question: The quadratic $8x^2+12x-14$ has two real roots. What is the sum of the squares of these roots? Express your answer as a common fraction in lowest terms.

Solution:
1. Simplify expressions involving radicals by multiplying and combining under a single radical if possible.
   - There are no radicals in the given quadratic equation, so no simplification is needed.

2. Rationalize the denominators of fractions with radicals by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
   - There are no fractions with radicals in the given quadratic equation, so no rationalization is needed.

3. Use the quadratic formula or factoring to find the roots of quadratic equations.
   - The quadratic formula is given by: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $ax^2+bx+c=0$.
   - For the given quadratic equation $8x^2+12x-14$, we have $a=8$, $b=12$, and $c=-14$.
   - Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
     $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^2-4(8)(-14)}}{2(8)}$
     $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144+448}}{16}$
     $x = \frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{592}}{16}$
     $x = \frac{-12 \pm 4\sqrt{37}}{16}$
     $x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{37}}{4}$
   - Therefore, the two real roots of the quadratic equation are $\frac{-3 + \sqrt{37}}{4}$ and $\frac{-3 - \sqrt{37}}{4}$.

4. Find the sum of the squares of the roots.
   - Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the quadratic equation.
   - The sum of the squares of the roots is given by $r_1^2 + r_2^2$.
   - Plugging in the values of the roots, we get:
     $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = \left(\frac{-3 + \sqrt{37}}{4}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{-3 - \sqrt{37}}{4}\right)^2$
     $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = \frac{(-3 + \sqrt{37})^2}{4^2} + \frac{(-3 - \sqrt{37})^2}{4^2}$
     $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = \frac{9 - 6\sqrt{37} + 37}{16} + \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{37} + 37}{16}$
     $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = \frac{2(9 + 37)}{16}$
     $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = \frac{2(46)}{16}$
     $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = \frac{92}{16}$
     $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = \frac{23}{4}$

Answer: The answer is $\frac{23}{4}$



Question: What is the product of all the coordinates of all the points of intersection of the two circles defined by $x^2-2x +y^2-10y+25=0$ and $x^2-8x+y^2-10y+37=0$?

Solution:
1. Simplify expressions involving radicals by multiplying and combining under a single radical if possible.
   The given equations are already simplified and do not involve radicals.

2. Rationalize the denominators of fractions with radicals by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
   There are no fractions with radicals in the given equations.

3. Use the quadratic formula or factoring to find the roots of quadratic equations.
   Let's find the roots of the first equation:
   $x^2-2x +y^2-10y+25=0$
   Rearranging the terms:
   $x^2 - 2x + y^2 - 10y = -25$
   Completing the square for the $x$ terms:
   $(x^2 - 2x + 1) + y^2 - 10y = -25 + 1$
   $(x - 1)^2 + y^2 - 10y = -24$
   Completing the square for the $y$ terms:
   $(x - 1)^2 + (y^2 - 10y + 25) = -24 + 25$
   $(x - 1)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 1$
   The equation represents a circle centered at $(1, 5)$ with radius 1.

   Now let's find the roots of the second equation:
   $x^2-8x+y^2-10y+37=0$
   Rearranging the terms:
   $x^2 - 8x + y^2 - 10y = -37$
   Completing the square for the $x$ terms:
   $(x^2 - 8x + 16) + y^2 - 10y = -37 + 16$
   $(x - 4)^2 + y^2 - 10y = -21$
   Completing the square for the $y$ terms:
   $(x - 4)^2 + (y^2 - 10y + 25) = -21 + 25$
   $(x - 4)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 4$
   The equation represents a circle centered at $(4, 5)$ with radius 2.

4. Find the coordinates of points of intersection between two curves by solving the system of equations formed by setting the two equations equal to each other.
   Setting the two equations equal to each other:
   $(x - 1)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 1$
   $(x - 4)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 4$
   Since both equations have the same $(y - 5)^2$ term, we can subtract the two equations to eliminate the $(y - 5)^2$ term:
   $(x - 1)^2 - (x - 4)^2 = 1 - 4$
   Expanding and simplifying:
   $(x^2 - 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 8x + 16) = -3$
   $-2x + 17 = -3$
   $-2x = -20$
   $x = 10$

   Substituting the value of $x$ into one of the original equations, let's use the first equation:
   $(10 - 1)^2 + (y - 5)^2 = 1$
   $81 + (y - 5)^2 = 1$
   $(y - 5)^2 = 1 - 81$
   $(y - 5)^2 = -80$
   Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, there are no real solutions for $y$.

   Therefore, there are no points of intersection between the two circles.

5. Find the product or sum of the roots of a quadratic equation by applying Vieta's formulas.
   Since there are no points of intersection, there are no roots to find the product of.

Answer: The answer is 10
