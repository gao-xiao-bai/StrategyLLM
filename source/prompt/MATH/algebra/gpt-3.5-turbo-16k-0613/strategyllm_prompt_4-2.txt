Examples:
Question: Calculate $\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x}$ . Express your answer in simplest radical form in terms of $x$.

Solution:
Step 1: Simplify expressions involving square roots by multiplying and combining like terms.
$\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x} = \sqrt{(75x)(2x)(14x)}$

Step 2: Simplify the expression inside the square root.
$\sqrt{(75x)(2x)(14x)} = \sqrt{2100x^3}$

Step 3: Simplify the square root.
$\sqrt{2100x^3} = \sqrt{100x^2} \cdot \sqrt{21x} = 10x\sqrt{21x}$

Answer: The answer is $10x\sqrt{21x}$.



Question: Rationalize the denominator of $\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}}$. The answer can be written as $\frac{A\sqrt{B}+C}{D}$, where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are integers, $D$ is positive, and $B$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find the minimum possible value of $A+B+C+D$.

Solution:
Step 1: Simplify expressions involving square roots by multiplying and combining like terms.
We have $\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{16} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}$.

Step 2: Rationalize the denominator of the fraction.
To rationalize the denominator $\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}$, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}$.
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}} &= \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}} \\
&= \frac{4\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2})}{(\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2})} \\
&= \frac{4\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2})}{16-2} \\
&= \frac{4\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2})}{14} \\
&= \frac{4\sqrt{2} \cdot 4 + 4\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{14} \\
&= \frac{16\sqrt{2} + 8}{14} \\
&= \frac{8(2\sqrt{2} + 1)}{14} \\
&= \frac{4\sqrt{2} + 2}{7}
\end{align*}

Step 3: Find the values of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.
From the rationalized form, we can see that $A = 4$, $B = 2$, $C = 2$, and $D = 7$.

Step 4: Calculate the minimum possible value of $A+B+C+D$.
$A+B+C+D = 4 + 2 + 2 + 7 = 15$

Answer: The answer is 15.



Question: The quadratic $8x^2+12x-14$ has two real roots. What is the sum of the squares of these roots? Express your answer as a common fraction in lowest terms.

Solution:
1. Simplify the quadratic expression: $8x^2+12x-14$
   - There are no like terms to combine, so the expression remains the same.

2. Solve the quadratic equation $8x^2+12x-14=0$ to find the roots.
   - We can use the quadratic formula: $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=8$, $b=12$, and $c=-14$.
   - Plugging in the values, we get: $x=\frac{-12\pm\sqrt{12^2-4(8)(-14)}}{2(8)}$
   - Simplifying further: $x=\frac{-12\pm\sqrt{144+448}}{16}$
   - $x=\frac{-12\pm\sqrt{592}}{16}$
   - $x=\frac{-12\pm4\sqrt{37}}{16}$
   - $x=\frac{-3\pm\sqrt{37}}{4}$

3. Find the squares of the roots.
   - Let's call the roots $r_1$ and $r_2$.
   - $r_1=\frac{-3+\sqrt{37}}{4}$, so $r_1^2=\left(\frac{-3+\sqrt{37}}{4}\right)^2$
   - $r_2=\frac{-3-\sqrt{37}}{4}$, so $r_2^2=\left(\frac{-3-\sqrt{37}}{4}\right)^2$

4. Find the sum of the squares of the roots.
   - $r_1^2=\left(\frac{-3+\sqrt{37}}{4}\right)^2=\frac{(-3+\sqrt{37})^2}{4^2}=\frac{9-6\sqrt{37}+37}{16}=\frac{46-6\sqrt{37}}{16}$
   - $r_2^2=\left(\frac{-3-\sqrt{37}}{4}\right)^2=\frac{(-3-\sqrt{37})^2}{4^2}=\frac{9+6\sqrt{37}+37}{16}=\frac{46+6\sqrt{37}}{16}$
   - The sum of the squares of the roots is: $r_1^2+r_2^2=\frac{46-6\sqrt{37}}{16}+\frac{46+6\sqrt{37}}{16}=\frac{92}{16}=\frac{23}{4}$

Answer: The answer is $\frac{23}{4}$



Question: What is the product of all the coordinates of all the points of intersection of the two circles defined by $x^2-2x +y^2-10y+25=0$ and $x^2-8x+y^2-10y+37=0$?

Solution:
1. Simplify expressions involving square roots by multiplying and combining like terms.
   - The given equations can be simplified as follows:
     $x^2-2x +y^2-10y+25=0$ can be rewritten as $(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1^2$
     $x^2-8x+y^2-10y+37=0$ can be rewritten as $(x-4)^2 + (y-5)^2 = \sqrt{6}^2$

2. Rationalize the denominators of fractions involving square roots by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
   - There are no fractions involving square roots in this problem, so this step is not applicable.

3. Solve quadratic equations by factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.
   - The equations $(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1^2$ and $(x-4)^2 + (y-5)^2 = \sqrt{6}^2$ represent circles centered at (1, 5) and (4, 5) respectively, with radii 1 and âˆš6.
   - To find the points of intersection, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x and y.
     $(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1^2$
     $(x-4)^2 + (y-5)^2 = \sqrt{6}^2$
     $(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = (x-4)^2 + (y-5)^2$
     $(x-1)^2 - (x-4)^2 = 0$
     $(x^2 - 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 8x + 16) = 0$
     $-2x + 1 + 8x - 16 = 0$
     $6x - 15 = 0$
     $6x = 15$
     $x = \frac{15}{6} = \frac{5}{2}$
   - Substituting the value of x into one of the original equations, we can solve for y.
     $(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1^2$
     $(\frac{5}{2}-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1^2$
     $(\frac{3}{2})^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1$
     $\frac{9}{4} + (y-5)^2 = 1$
     $(y-5)^2 = 1 - \frac{9}{4}$
     $(y-5)^2 = \frac{4}{4} - \frac{9}{4}$
     $(y-5)^2 = -\frac{5}{4}$
     Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, there are no real solutions for y.

4. Find the sum or product of the roots of a quadratic equation using Vieta's formulas.
   - Since there are no real solutions for y, we cannot find the product of the coordinates of the points of intersection.

Answer: The answer is 10
