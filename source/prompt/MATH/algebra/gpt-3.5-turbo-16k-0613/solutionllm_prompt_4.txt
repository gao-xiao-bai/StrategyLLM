Question: Calculate $\sqrt{75x} \cdot \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{14x}$ . Express your answer in simplest radical form in terms of $x$.
Solution: To simplify the expression, we can combine the square roots and simplify the coefficients. 

First, let's simplify the coefficients:
$\sqrt{75x} = \sqrt{25 \cdot 3x} = \sqrt{25} \cdot \sqrt{3x} = 5 \cdot \sqrt{3x}$
$\sqrt{2x} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{x}$

Now, let's combine the square roots:
$5 \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{14x} = 5 \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{14} \cdot \sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{x}$
$= 5 \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{14} \cdot x$
$= 5x \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{14}$

Therefore, the simplified expression is $5x \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{14}$.
Answer: The answer is $5x \cdot \sqrt{3x} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{14}$.



Question: Rationalize the denominator of $\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}}$. The answer can be written as $\frac{A\sqrt{B}+C}{D}$, where $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are integers, $D$ is positive, and $B$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find the minimum possible value of $A+B+C+D$.
Solution: To rationalize the denominator, we need to eliminate the square root in the denominator. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}$.

$\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}}$

Simplifying the numerator and denominator separately, we have:

Numerator: $\sqrt{32} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{16} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}$

Denominator: $(\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}) = 16 - \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{16} \cdot \sqrt{2} - 2 = 16 - 2\sqrt{32} + 2\sqrt{32} - 2 = 14$

Putting it all together, we have:

$\frac{\sqrt{32}}{\sqrt{16}-\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{16}+\sqrt{2}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{14} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7}$

Therefore, $A=2$, $B=2$, $C=0$, and $D=7$. The minimum possible value of $A+B+C+D$ is $2+2+0+7 = 11$.

Answer: The answer is 11.



Question: The quadratic $8x^2+12x-14$ has two real roots. What is the sum of the squares of these roots? Express your answer as a common fraction in lowest terms.
Solution: To find the sum of the squares of the roots, we need to find the roots of the quadratic equation $8x^2+12x-14=0$. We can do this by factoring or by using the quadratic formula.

Using the quadratic formula, we have $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=8$, $b=12$, and $c=-14$.

Plugging in the values, we get:
$x=\frac{-12\pm\sqrt{12^2-4(8)(-14)}}{2(8)}$
$x=\frac{-12\pm\sqrt{144+448}}{16}$
$x=\frac{-12\pm\sqrt{592}}{16}$
$x=\frac{-12\pm4\sqrt{37}}{16}$
$x=\frac{-3\pm\sqrt{37}}{4}$

The two real roots are $\frac{-3+\sqrt{37}}{4}$ and $\frac{-3-\sqrt{37}}{4}$.

To find the sum of the squares of these roots, we square each root and add them together:
$\left(\frac{-3+\sqrt{37}}{4}\right)^2+\left(\frac{-3-\sqrt{37}}{4}\right)^2$
$\frac{(-3+\sqrt{37})^2}{4^2}+\frac{(-3-\sqrt{37})^2}{4^2}$
$\frac{9-6\sqrt{37}+37}{16}+\frac{9+6\sqrt{37}+37}{16}$
$\frac{55+2\cdot6\sqrt{37}}{16}+\frac{55-2\cdot6\sqrt{37}}{16}$
$\frac{110}{16}$
$\frac{55}{8}$

Answer: The answer is $\frac{55}{8}$



Question: What is the product of all the coordinates of all the points of intersection of the two circles defined by $x^2-2x +y^2-10y+25=0$ and $x^2-8x+y^2-10y+37=0$?
Solution: To find the points of intersection, we need to solve the system of equations formed by the two circle equations.

First, let's simplify the equations by completing the square. For the first equation, we have:
$(x^2-2x) + (y^2-10y) + 25 = 0$
$(x^2-2x+1) + (y^2-10y+25) + 25 = 1$
$(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1$

Similarly, for the second equation, we have:
$(x^2-8x) + (y^2-10y) + 37 = 0$
$(x^2-8x+16) + (y^2-10y+25) + 37 = 16$
$(x-4)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 16$

Now we have two circle equations in standard form:
$(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1$
$(x-4)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 16$

By comparing the equations, we can see that both circles have the same center at (1, 5), but different radii (1 and 4).

To find the points of intersection, we can solve the system of equations:
$(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1$
$(x-4)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 16$

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
$(x-4)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 16 - 1$
$(x^2 - 8x + 16) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 15$
$-6x + 15 = 15$
$-6x = 0$
$x = 0$

Substituting x = 0 into the first equation, we get:
$(0-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 1$
$1 + (y-5)^2 = 1$
$(y-5)^2 = 0$
$y - 5 = 0$
$y = 5$

Therefore, the two circles intersect at the point (0, 5).

The product of the coordinates of this point is 0 * 5 = 0.

Answer: The answer is 0.
