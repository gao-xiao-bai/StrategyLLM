Question: Find the quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ such that $p(-3) = 10,$ $p(0) = 1,$ and $p(2) = 5.$

Solution:
1. Identify the problem type:
   - This problem involves finding a quadratic polynomial based on given values.

2. Read and understand the problem:
   - We need to find a quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ that satisfies the given conditions.

3. Represent the problem algebraically:
   - Let $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ be the quadratic polynomial we need to find.
   - We have the following equations based on the given conditions:
     - $p(-3) = 10 \Rightarrow a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c = 10$
     - $p(0) = 1 \Rightarrow a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 1$
     - $p(2) = 5 \Rightarrow a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 5$

4. Solve the algebraic problem:
   - Simplify the equations:
     - $9a - 3b + c = 10$
     - $c = 1$
     - $4a + 2b + c = 5$
   - Substitute $c = 1$ into the other equations:
     - $9a - 3b + 1 = 10$
     - $4a + 2b + 1 = 5$
   - Simplify the equations further:
     - $9a - 3b = 9$
     - $4a + 2b = 4$
   - Solve the system of equations:
     - Multiply the second equation by 3 to eliminate $b$:
       - $12a + 6b = 12$
     - Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation:
       - $12a + 6b - (9a - 3b) = 12 - 9$
       - $3a + 9b = 3$
     - Divide the equation by 3 to solve for $a$:
       - $a + 3b = 1$
     - Substitute $a = 1 - 3b$ into the first equation:
       - $9(1 - 3b) - 3b = 9$
       - $9 - 27b - 3b = 9$
       - $-30b = 0$
       - $b = 0$
     - Substitute $b = 0$ into $a = 1 - 3b$:
       - $a = 1 - 3(0)$
       - $a = 1$
     - Substitute $a = 1$ and $b = 0$ into $c = 1$:
       - $c = 1$

5. Check the solution:
   - Substitute $a = 1$, $b = 0$, and $c = 1$ into the original equations:
     - $9(1) - 3(0) + 1 = 10$
     - $4(1) + 2(0) + 1 = 5$

Question: For $-25 \le x \le 25,$ find the maximum value of $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}.$

Solution:
1. Identify the problem type:
   - This problem involves finding the maximum value of an expression.

2. Read and understand the problem:
   - The problem asks us to find the maximum value of $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}$ for $-25 \le x \le 25$.

3. Represent the problem algebraically:
   - Let $f(x) = \sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}$.

4. Solve the algebraic problem:
   - To find the maximum value of $f(x)$, we can take the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero to find critical points.
   - Taking the derivative of $f(x)$, we have:
     $f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 + x}} - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 - x}}$
   - Setting $f'(x) = 0$ and solving for $x$, we get:
     $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 + x}} - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 - x}} = 0$
     $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 + x}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 - x}}$
     $\sqrt{25 + x} = \sqrt{25 - x}$
     $25 + x = 25 - x$
     $2x = 0$
     $x = 0$
   - The critical point is $x = 0$.

5. Check the solution:
   - We need to check if $x = 0$ is within the given range $-25 \le x \le 25$.
   - Since $0$ is within the range, we can proceed to evaluate $f(x)$ at $x = 0$.
   - $f(0) = \sqrt{25 + 0} + \sqrt{25 - 0} = \sqrt{25} + \sqrt{25} = 5 + 5 = 10$.

6. Communicate the answer:
   - The maximum value of $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}$ for $-25 \le x \le 25$ is $10$.
   
Answer: The answer is 10



Question: The hyperbolas \[\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1\]and \[\frac{y^2}{18} - \frac{x^2}{N} = 1\]have the same asymptotes. Find $N.$

Solution:
1. Identify the problem type:
   - This problem involves finding the value of a variable in an equation.

2. Read and understand the problem:
   - We are given two hyperbolas and we need to find the value of $N$.

3. Represent the problem algebraically:
   - The equation of the first hyperbola is $\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1$.
   - The equation of the second hyperbola is $\frac{y^2}{18} - \frac{x^2}{N} = 1$.

4. Solve the algebraic problem:
   - To find the value of $N$, we need to compare the equations of the asymptotes of the two hyperbolas.
   - The equation of the asymptotes of a hyperbola of the form $\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$ is $y = \pm \frac{b}{a}x$.
   - Comparing the equations of the asymptotes of the two hyperbolas, we have $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{b}{a} = \frac{\sqrt{N}}{3}$.
   - Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get $\frac{3}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{N}}{3}$.
   - Solving for $N$, we have $N = 9 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 9 \cdot \frac{9}{4} = \frac{81}{4} = 20.25$.

5. Check the solution:
   - Substituting $N = 20.25$ into the equation of the second hyperbola, we have $\frac{y^2}{18} - \frac{x^2}{20.25} = 1$.
   - Simplifying this equation, we get $\frac{y^2}{18} - \frac{x^2}{20.25} = 1$.
   - This equation represents a hyperbola with the same asymptotes as the first hyperbola.
   - Therefore, the solution $N = 20.25$ is correct.

6. Communicate the answer:
   - The value of $N$ is $20.25$.
   - The answer is $The answer is 20.25$.
