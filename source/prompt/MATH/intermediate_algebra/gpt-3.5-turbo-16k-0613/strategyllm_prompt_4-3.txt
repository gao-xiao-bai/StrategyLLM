Examples:
Question: Find the quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ such that $p(-3) = 10,$ $p(0) = 1,$ and $p(2) = 5.$

Solution:
Step 1: Solve linear equations
We are given three points on the quadratic polynomial: $(-3, 10),$ $(0, 1),$ and $(2, 5).$ We can use these points to form three linear equations and solve for the coefficients of the quadratic polynomial.

Let's start with the point $(-3, 10).$ Plugging in $x = -3$ and $p(x) = 10$ into the quadratic polynomial $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c,$ we get:
$10 = a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c$
Simplifying, we have:
$10 = 9a - 3b + c$   ...(Equation 1)

Next, let's use the point $(0, 1).$ Plugging in $x = 0$ and $p(x) = 1$ into the quadratic polynomial, we get:
$1 = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c$
Simplifying, we have:
$1 = c$   ...(Equation 2)

Finally, let's use the point $(2, 5).$ Plugging in $x = 2$ and $p(x) = 5$ into the quadratic polynomial, we get:
$5 = a(2)^2 + b(2) + c$
Simplifying, we have:
$5 = 4a + 2b + c$   ...(Equation 3)

Step 2: Solve the system of linear equations
Now, we have a system of three linear equations:
$10 = 9a - 3b + c$   ...(Equation 1)
$1 = c$   ...(Equation 2)
$5 = 4a + 2b + c$   ...(Equation 3)

Substituting Equation 2 into Equations 1 and 3, we get:
$10 = 9a - 3b + 1$   ...(Equation 1')
$5 = 4a + 2b + 1$   ...(Equation 3')

Simplifying Equations 1' and 3', we have:
$9a - 3b = 9$   ...(Equation 4)
$4a + 2b = 4$   ...(Equation 5)

Multiplying Equation 5 by 2, we get:
$8a + 4b = 8$   ...(Equation 6)

Subtracting Equation 4 from Equation 6, we eliminate $b$:
$8a + 4b - (9a - 3b) = 8 - 9$
$-a + 7b = -1$   ...(Equation 7)

Solving Equation 7 for $a$, we have:
$a = 7b + 1$   ...(Equation 8)

Step 3: Substitute the value of $a$ into Equation 4
Substituting Equation 8 into Equation 4, we have:
$9(7b + 1) - 3b = 9$
$63b + 9 - 3b = 9$
$60b = 0$
$b = 0$

Step 4: Substitute the value of $b$ into Equation 8
Substituting $b = 0$ into Equation 8, we have:
$a = 7(0) + 1$
$a = 1$

Step 5: Write the quadratic polynomial
Now that we have found the values of $a$ and $b$, we can write the quadratic polynomial $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ as:
$p(x) = 1x^2 + 0x + 1$
$p(x) = x^2 + 1$

Answer: The answer is $x^2 + 1$



Question: Calculate: $\frac53\times\frac{6}{10}\times\frac{15}{9}\times\frac{12}{20}\times\frac{25}{15}\times\frac{18}{30}\times\frac{35}{21}\times\frac{24}{40}$

Solution:
Step 1: Simplify each fraction:
$\frac{5}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}\times\frac{5}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}\times\frac{5}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}\times\frac{5}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}$

Step 2: Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together:
$\frac{5\times3\times5\times3\times5\times3\times5\times3}{3\times5\times3\times5\times3\times5\times3\times5}$

Step 3: Cancel out common factors:
$\frac{5\times3\times5\times3\times5\times3\times5\times3}{3\times5\times3\times5\times3\times5\times3\times5} = \frac{5^3\times3^3}{3^3\times5^3}$

Step 4: Simplify the expression:
$\frac{5^3\times3^3}{3^3\times5^3} = \frac{1}{1}$

Answer: The answer is 1



Question: For $-25 \le x \le 25,$ find the maximum value of $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}.$

Solution:
1. Simplify the expression $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}$:
   - We can't simplify the expression further, so we move on to the next step.

2. Find the critical points by setting the derivative of the expression equal to zero:
   - Let $f(x) = \sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}$.
   - Find the derivative of $f(x)$:
     - $f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 + x}} - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 - x}}$.
   - Set $f'(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$:
     - $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 + x}} - \frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 - x}} = 0$.
     - $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 + x}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{25 - x}}$.
     - $\sqrt{25 + x} = \sqrt{25 - x}$.
     - Square both sides of the equation:
       - $25 + x = 25 - x$.
       - $2x = 0$.
       - $x = 0$.

3. Check the endpoints of the given interval:
   - Substitute $x = -25$ and $x = 25$ into the expression $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}$:
     - $\sqrt{25 + (-25)} + \sqrt{25 - (-25)} = \sqrt{0} + \sqrt{50} = 0 + \sqrt{50} = \sqrt{50}$.
     - $\sqrt{25 + 25} + \sqrt{25 - 25} = \sqrt{50} + \sqrt{0} = \sqrt{50} + 0 = \sqrt{50}$.

4. Compare the values obtained from step 2 and step 3:
   - The critical point $x = 0$ gives the same value as the endpoints of the interval, $\sqrt{50}$.

Answer: The answer is $\sqrt{50}$.



Question: The hyperbolas \[\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1\]and \[\frac{y^2}{18} - \frac{x^2}{N} = 1\]have the same asymptotes. Find $N.$

Solution:
1. Simplify the equations:
   \[\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1\]
   \[\frac{y^2}{18} - \frac{x^2}{N} = 1\]

2. Rewrite the equations in standard form:
   \[\frac{x^2}{2^2} - \frac{y^2}{3^2} = 1\]
   \[\frac{y^2}{(3\sqrt{2})^2} - \frac{x^2}{(\sqrt{N})^2} = 1\]

3. Compare the equations to the standard form of a hyperbola:
   \[\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\]
   \[\frac{y^2}{c^2} - \frac{x^2}{d^2} = 1\]

4. From the standard form, we can see that the asymptotes of the hyperbola are given by the equations:
   \[y = \pm \frac{b}{a}x\]
   \[y = \pm \frac{c}{d}x\]

5. Comparing the coefficients, we have:
   \[\frac{b}{a} = \frac{3}{2}\]
   \[\frac{c}{d} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{N}}\]

6. Equating the two expressions for the slopes of the asymptotes, we get:
   \[\frac{3}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{N}}\]

7. Solve for N:
   \[\frac{3}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{N}}\]
   \[2\sqrt{N} = 2\sqrt{2}\]
   \[N = 8\]

Answer: The answer is 8
