Question: Find the quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ such that $p(-3) = 10,$ $p(0) = 1,$ and $p(2) = 5.$
Solution: Let's assume the quadratic polynomial $p(x)$ is of the form $ax^2 + bx + c.$

We are given three conditions:
1. $p(-3) = 10$
2. $p(0) = 1$
3. $p(2) = 5$

Substituting the values of $x$ in each condition, we get:
1. $a(-3)^2 + b(-3) + c = 10$
2. $a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 1$
3. $a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 5$

Simplifying each equation, we have:
1. $9a - 3b + c = 10$
2. $c = 1$
3. $4a + 2b + c = 5$

Since we know $c = 1,$ we can substitute it in equations 1 and 3:
1. $9a - 3b + 1 = 10$
3. $4a + 2b + 1 = 5$

Simplifying further, we get:
1. $9a - 3b = 9$
3. $4a + 2b = 4$

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $a$ and $b.$

Multiplying equation 3 by 3, we get:
$12a + 6b = 12$

Adding this equation to equation 1, we have:
$9a - 3b + 12a + 6b = 9 + 12$

Simplifying, we get:
$21a + 3b = 21$

Dividing this equation by 3, we get:
$7a + b = 7$

Now, we have two equations:
1. $7a + b = 7$
2. $4a + 2b = 4$

Multiplying equation 1 by 2, we get:
$14a + 2b = 14$

Subtracting equation 2 from this equation, we have:
$14a + 2b - (4a + 2b) = 14 - 4$

Simplifying, we get:
$10a = 10$

Dividing both sides by 10, we get:
$a = 1$

Substituting the value of $a$ in equation 1, we have:
$7(1) + b = 7$

Simplifying, we get:
$7 + b = 7$

Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get:
$b = 0$

Therefore, the values of $a$ and $b$ are 1 and 0 respectively.

Now, we can substitute these values in the quadratic polynomial $p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ to find the final polynomial.

$p(x) = 1x^2 + 0x + 1$

Simplifying, we get:
$p(x) = x^2 + 1$

Answer: The answer is $x^2 + 1$



Question: Calculate: $\frac53\times\frac{6}{10}\times\frac{15}{9}\times\frac{12}{20}\times\frac{25}{15}\times\frac{18}{30}\times\frac{35}{21}\times\frac{24}{40}$
Solution: To solve this problem, we can simplify each fraction and then multiply them together. 

$\frac53\times\frac{6}{10}\times\frac{15}{9}\times\frac{12}{20}\times\frac{25}{15}\times\frac{18}{30}\times\frac{35}{21}\times\frac{24}{40}$

First, let's simplify each fraction:

$\frac{5}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}\times\frac{5}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}\times\frac{5}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}\times\frac{5}{3}\times\frac{3}{5}$

Next, we can cancel out the common factors in the numerator and denominator of each fraction:

$1\times1\times1\times1\times1\times1\times1\times1$

Finally, we multiply all the remaining factors together:

$1$

Answer: The answer is 1



Question: For $-25 \le x \le 25,$ find the maximum value of $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}.$
Solution: To find the maximum value of $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x},$ we can use the fact that the sum of two square roots is maximized when the two square roots are equal. In this case, we want to find the maximum value of $\sqrt{25 + x}$ and $\sqrt{25 - x}$ separately.

First, let's consider $\sqrt{25 + x}.$ Since $-25 \le x \le 25,$ we know that $0 \le 25 + x \le 50.$ Therefore, $0 \le \sqrt{25 + x} \le \sqrt{50}.$

Next, let's consider $\sqrt{25 - x}.$ Since $-25 \le x \le 25,$ we know that $0 \le 25 - x \le 50.$ Therefore, $0 \le \sqrt{25 - x} \le \sqrt{50}.$

Since $\sqrt{25 + x}$ and $\sqrt{25 - x}$ are both less than or equal to $\sqrt{50},$ their sum $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}$ is less than or equal to $2\sqrt{50}.$

To find the maximum value, we need to find the value of $x$ that makes $\sqrt{25 + x}$ and $\sqrt{25 - x}$ equal. Setting them equal, we have $\sqrt{25 + x} = \sqrt{25 - x}.$ Squaring both sides, we get $25 + x = 25 - x.$ Solving for $x,$ we find $x = 0.$

Therefore, the maximum value of $\sqrt{25 + x} + \sqrt{25 - x}$ is $2\sqrt{50}$ when $x = 0.$

Answer: The answer is $2\sqrt{50}$



Question: The hyperbolas \[\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1\]and \[\frac{y^2}{18} - \frac{x^2}{N} = 1\]have the same asymptotes. Find $N.$
Solution: The equation of a hyperbola with center at the origin and asymptotes given by $y = mx$ and $y = -mx$ is of the form \[\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1,\]where $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers.

Comparing the given equation \[\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{9} = 1\]with the standard form, we have $a^2 = 4$ and $b^2 = 9.$ Therefore, $a = 2$ and $b = 3.$

The equation \[\frac{y^2}{18} - \frac{x^2}{N} = 1\]has the same asymptotes as the first hyperbola. This means that $a$ and $b$ for this hyperbola must also be $2$ and $3,$ respectively.

Comparing this equation with the standard form, we have $a^2 = 3$ and $b^2 = 18.$ Therefore, $a = \sqrt{3}$ and $b = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}.$

Since $a = 2$ for the first hyperbola and $a = \sqrt{3}$ for the second hyperbola, we must have $2 = \sqrt{3}.$ Squaring both sides, we get $4 = 3.$ This is not true, so our assumption that the two hyperbolas have the same asymptotes is incorrect.

Therefore, there is no value of $N$ that satisfies the given conditions.

Answer: The answer is There is no value of $N$ that satisfies the given conditions.
