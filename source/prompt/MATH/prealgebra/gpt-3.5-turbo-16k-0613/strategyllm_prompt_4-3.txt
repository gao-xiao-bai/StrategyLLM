Examples:
Question: Pete thinks of a number. He doubles it, adds 10, multiplies by 4, and ends up with 120. What was his original number?
Solution:
1. Understand the problem statement and identify the variables involved.
   - Pete's original number (unknown variable)

2. Translate the problem statement into a mathematical equation or inequality.
   - Let x be Pete's original number.
   - Pete doubles his original number: 2x
   - Pete adds 10 to the doubled number: 2x + 10
   - Pete multiplies the sum by 4: 4(2x + 10)
   - The result is 120: 4(2x + 10) = 120

3. Solve the equation or inequality to find the value of the unknown variable.
   - Distribute 4 to the terms inside the parentheses: 8x + 40 = 120
   - Subtract 40 from both sides: 8x = 80
   - Divide both sides by 8: x = 10

4. Check the solution by substituting the value back into the original equation or inequality.
   - Substitute x = 10 into the equation: 4(2(10) + 10) = 120
   - Simplify: 4(20 + 10) = 120
   - Simplify further: 4(30) = 120
   - The equation is true, so the solution is correct.
