Question: Pete thinks of a number. He doubles it, adds 10, multiplies by 4, and ends up with 120. What was his original number?
Solution: Let Pete's original number be $x$.  If he double it and adds 10, he will have $$2x+10.$$ After multiplying by 4, Pete ended up with 120.  From this information, we have the equation: $$4(2x+10)=120.$$ Expanding the left side and solving, we find:

\begin{align*}
8x+40&=120\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 8x&=80\\
\Rightarrow \qquad x&=\boxed{10}.
\end{align*}
Answer: The answer is 10



Question: A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\spadesuit$, $\heartsuit$, $\diamondsuit$, and $\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\spadesuit$ and $\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\heartsuit$ and $\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is a $\heartsuit$?
Solution: There are 13 $\heartsuit$'s and 52 cards total, so the probability that the top card is a $\heartsuit$ is $\dfrac{13}{52} = \boxed{\dfrac14}$.
Answer: The answer is \frac{1}{4}



Question: A number in the set $\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction.
Solution: To count the number of numbers in this set, we subtract 49 from all of the numbers, giving the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots , 950 \}$, making it obvious that there are 950 numbers total. Furthermore, the set $\{ 50, 51, 52, \ldots, 98, 99 \}$ corresponds to the more easily counted $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots , 49, 50 \}$ by subtracting 49. So, the probability of selecting a two-digit number is $\frac{50}{950} = \boxed{\frac{1}{19}}$.
Answer: The answer is \frac{1}{19}



Question: A pentagon is drawn by placing an isosceles right triangle on top of a square as pictured. What percent of the area of the pentagon is the area of the right triangle?

[asy]
size(50);
draw((0,0)--(0,-1)--(1,-1)--(1,0)--(0,0)--(.5,.5)--(1,0));
[/asy]
Solution: Let the leg length of the isosceles right triangle be $x$, so the hypotenuse of the triangle has length $x\sqrt{2}$.  The hypotenuse of the triangle is a side of the square, so the area of the square is $(x\sqrt{2})^2 = 2x^2$.  The area of the triangle is $(x)(x)/2 = x^2/2$.  So, the area of the pentagon is  \[\frac{x^2}{2} + 2x^2 = \frac{5x^2}{2}.\]Therefore, the fraction of the pentagon's area that is inside the triangle is  \[\frac{x^2/2}{5x^2/2} =\frac{x^2}{2}\cdot \frac{2}{5x^2} = \frac15 = \boxed{20\%}.\](As an alternate solution, consider drawing the two diagonals of the square. What do you find?)
Answer: The answer is 20
