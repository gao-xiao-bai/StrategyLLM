Examples:
Question: Pete thinks of a number. He doubles it, adds 10, multiplies by 4, and ends up with 120. What was his original number?
Solution: 
1. Let's assume the original number Pete thought of as 'x'.
2. Pete doubles the number: 2x
3. Pete adds 10 to the doubled number: 2x + 10
4. Pete multiplies the sum by 4: 4(2x + 10)
5. The result is 120, so we can set up the equation: 4(2x + 10) = 120
6. Simplifying the equation: 8x + 40 = 120
7. Subtracting 40 from both sides: 8x = 80
8. Dividing both sides by 8: x = 10
Answer: The answer is 10



Question: A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\spadesuit$, $\heartsuit$, $\diamondsuit$, and $\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\spadesuit$ and $\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\heartsuit$ and $\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is a $\heartsuit$?

Solution:
1. Given information:
- There are 52 cards in a standard deck.
- There are 13 ranks and 4 suits.
- Two suits are black ($\spadesuit$ and $\clubsuit$) and two suits are red ($\heartsuit$ and $\diamondsuit$).

2. Mathematical concepts and formulas:
- Probability: The probability of an event happening is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

3. Solution:
- Total number of possible outcomes: There are 52 cards in the deck, so the total number of possible outcomes is 52.
- Number of favorable outcomes: There are 13 $\heartsuit$ cards in the deck, so the number of favorable outcomes is 13.
- Probability: The probability of drawing a $\heartsuit$ card as the top card is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
Probability = 13 / 52
Probability = 1/4

4. Answer:
The answer is $\frac{1}{4}$.



Question: A number in the set $\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\}$ is randomly selected. What is the probability that it is a two-digit number? Express your answer as a common fraction.

Solution:
1. Given information: The set of numbers is $\{50, 51, 52, 53, ... , 999\}$.
2. We need to find the probability that a randomly selected number from this set is a two-digit number.
3. Mathematical concept/formula: Probability is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
4. Let's determine the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes:
   - Favorable outcomes: The two-digit numbers in the set are $\{50, 51, 52, ..., 99\}$. There are 50 two-digit numbers in total.
   - Total number of possible outcomes: The set contains all numbers from 50 to 999, inclusive. So, there are 950 possible outcomes.
5. Now, we can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:
   - Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
   - Probability = 50 / 950
   - Probability = 1/19
6. The answer is $\frac{1}{19}$.



Question: A pentagon is drawn by placing an isosceles right triangle on top of a square as pictured. What percent of the area of the pentagon is the area of the right triangle?

[asy]
size(50);
draw((0,0)--(0,-1)--(1,-1)--(1,0)--(0,0)--(.5,.5)--(1,0));
[/asy]

Solution:
1. Given information:
   - A pentagon is formed by placing an isosceles right triangle on top of a square.
   
2. To solve the problem, we need to find the percent of the area of the pentagon that is occupied by the right triangle.

3. Mathematical concepts and formulas:
   - Area of a square: side^2
   - Area of an isosceles right triangle: (base * height) / 2
   - Percent: (part / whole) * 100
   
4. Let's calculate the area of the pentagon and the area of the right triangle:
   - Area of the square: side^2 = 1^2 = 1
   - Area of the right triangle: (base * height) / 2 = (1 * 1) / 2 = 1/2
   
5. Now, let's calculate the percent of the area of the pentagon occupied by the right triangle:
   - Percent: (area of the right triangle / area of the pentagon) * 100 = (1/2 / 1) * 100 = 50/100 * 100 = 50
   
Answer: The answer is 50.
