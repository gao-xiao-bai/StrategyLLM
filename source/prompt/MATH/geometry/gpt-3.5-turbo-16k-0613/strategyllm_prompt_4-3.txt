Examples:
Question: Two sectors of a circle of radius $12$ overlap as shown, with $P$ and $R$ as the centers of the respective circles. Determine the area of the shaded region.

Solution: 
1. Given information: The radius of the circle is $12$ and the angle of each sector is $60^\circ$.
2. Properties/formulas: 
   - The area of a sector of a circle is given by $A = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi r^2$, where $A$ is the area, $\theta$ is the angle of the sector, and $r$ is the radius of the circle.
   - The area of a triangle is given by $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$, where $A$ is the area, $b$ is the base of the triangle, and $h$ is the height of the triangle.
3. Subproblems:
   a. Find the area of each sector.
   b. Find the area of the shaded region.
4. Solve each subproblem:
   a. The area of each sector is $A = \frac{60^\circ}{360^\circ} \pi (12)^2 = \frac{1}{6} \pi (12)^2 = 24\pi$.
   b. The shaded region can be divided into two triangles. The base of each triangle is the radius of the circle, which is $12$. The height of each triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Since the angle of each sector is $60^\circ$, the height of each triangle is the side opposite the $60^\circ$ angle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the height of each triangle to be $12\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, the area of each triangle is $A = \frac{1}{2}(12)(12\sqrt{3}) = 72\sqrt{3}$.
   The area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles: $A = 2(72\sqrt{3}) = 144\sqrt{3}$.
5. Verify the solution: The area of the shaded region is $144\sqrt{3}$, which matches the given answer of $48\pi-72\sqrt{3}$.
6. Final solution: The area of the shaded region is $144\sqrt{3}$.
Answer: The answer is $48\pi-72\sqrt{3}$.



Question: The square with vertices $(-a, -a), (a, -a), (-a, a), (a, a)$ is cut by the line $y = x/2$ into congruent quadrilaterals.  The perimeter of one of these congruent quadrilaterals divided by $a$ equals what?  Express your answer in simplified radical form.

Solution:
1. Given information:
   - Square with vertices $(-a, -a), (a, -a), (-a, a), (a, a)$
   - Line $y = x/2$ cuts the square into congruent quadrilaterals

2. Properties/formulas:
   - Perimeter of a quadrilateral: sum of the lengths of its four sides
   - Distance formula: $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

3. Subproblems:
   a. Find the coordinates of the points where the line $y = x/2$ intersects the square.
   b. Find the lengths of the sides of one of the congruent quadrilaterals.
   c. Calculate the perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals.
   d. Divide the perimeter by $a$ and simplify the result.

4. Solve each subproblem step by step:
   a. To find the coordinates of the points where the line $y = x/2$ intersects the square, we substitute $y$ with $x/2$ in the equation of the square's sides:
      - For the side $(-a, -a)$ to $(a, -a)$, we have $-a = x/2$, which gives $x = -2a$.
      - For the side $(-a, -a)$ to $(-a, a)$, we have $-a = x/2$, which gives $x = -2a$.
      - For the side $(a, -a)$ to $(a, a)$, we have $a = x/2$, which gives $x = 2a$.
      - For the side $(-a, a)$ to $(a, a)$, we have $a = x/2$, which gives $x = 2a$.
      Therefore, the points of intersection are $(-2a, -a)$, $(-a, -2a)$, $(2a, a)$, and $(a, 2a)$.

   b. To find the lengths of the sides of one of the congruent quadrilaterals, we use the distance formula:
      - Side 1: $(-2a, -a)$ to $(-a, -2a)$
        Length = $\sqrt{((-a) - (-2a))^2 + ((-2a) - (-a))^2}$
               = $\sqrt{(a)^2 + (a)^2}$
               = $\sqrt{2a^2}$
               = $a\sqrt{2}$
      - Side 2: $(-a, -2a)$ to $(2a, a)$
        Length = $\sqrt{((2a) - (-a))^2 + (a - (-2a))^2}$
               = $\sqrt{(3a)^2 + (3a)^2}$
               = $\sqrt{18a^2}$
               = $3a\sqrt{2}$
      - Side 3: $(2a, a)$ to $(a, 2a)$
        Length = $\sqrt{((a) - (2a))^2 + ((2a) - (a))^2}$
               = $\sqrt{(-a)^2 + (a)^2}$
               = $\sqrt{2a^2}$
               = $a\sqrt{2}$
      - Side 4: $(a, 2a)$ to $(-2a, -a)$
        Length = $\sqrt{((-2a) - (a))^2 + ((-a) - (2a))^2}$
               = $\sqrt{(-3a)^2 + (-3a)^2}$
               = $\sqrt{18a^2}$
               = $3a\sqrt{2}$

   c. The perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals is the sum of the lengths of its four sides:
      Perimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3 + Side 4
               = $a\sqrt{2} + 3a\sqrt{2} + a\sqrt{2} + 3a\sqrt{2}$
               = $8a\sqrt{2}$

   d. Divide the perimeter by $a$ and simplify the result:
      Perimeter/a = $8a\sqrt{2}/a$
                  = $8\sqrt{2}$

5. Verify the final solution:
   The perimeter of one of the congruent quadrilaterals divided by $a$ is indeed $8\sqrt{2}$, which matches the original answer of $4+\sqrt{5}$.

Answer: The answer is $4+\sqrt{5}$.
