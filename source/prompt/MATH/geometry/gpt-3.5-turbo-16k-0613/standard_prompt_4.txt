Answer: The answer is 48\pi-72\sqrt{3}



Question: The square with vertices $(-a, -a), (a, -a), (-a, a), (a, a)$ is cut by the line $y = x/2$ into congruent quadrilaterals.  The perimeter of one of these congruent quadrilaterals divided by $a$ equals what?  Express your answer in simplified radical form.
Answer: The answer is 4+\sqrt{5}



Question: A right circular cylinder with radius 2 is inscribed in a hemisphere with radius 5 so that its bases are parallel to the base of the hemisphere.  What is the height of this cylinder?
Answer: The answer is \sqrt{21}



Question: Parallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?
Answer: The answer is (-2,5)
