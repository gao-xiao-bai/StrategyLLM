Examples:
Question: Let $x$ be a positive integer such that $9x\equiv 1\pmod{25}$.

What is the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$?

Solution:
1. Understand the problem: We are given a congruence $9x\equiv 1\pmod{25}$ and we need to find the remainder when $11+x$ is divided by $25$.

2. Apply basic number theory concepts: We can use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. 

3. Simplify expressions: We can simplify the given congruence by multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of $9$ modulo $25$. 

4. Solve congruences: To find the modular inverse of $9$ modulo $25$, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. 

5. Study patterns and properties: There are no specific patterns or properties that can be used in this problem.

6. Use prime factorization: There is no need to use prime factorization in this problem.

7. Apply number theory theorems: There are no specific number theory theorems that can be applied in this problem.

8. Check for divisibility: There is no need to check for divisibility in this problem.

9. Solve step-by-step:
   a. We have the congruence $9x\equiv 1\pmod{25}$.
   b. To find the modular inverse of $9$ modulo $25$, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
      - $25 = 2 \cdot 9 + 7$
      - $9 = 1 \cdot 7 + 2$
      - $7 = 3 \cdot 2 + 1$
      - $1 = 7 - 3 \cdot 2$
      - $1 = 7 - 3 \cdot (9 - 1 \cdot 7)$
      - $1 = 4 \cdot 7 - 3 \cdot 9$
      - $1 = 4 \cdot (25 - 2 \cdot 9) - 3 \cdot 9$
      - $1 = 4 \cdot 25 - 11 \cdot 9$
   c. Therefore, the modular inverse of $9$ modulo $25$ is $-11$.
   d. Multiplying both sides of the congruence $9x\equiv 1\pmod{25}$ by $-11$, we get $x\equiv -11\pmod{25}$.
   e. Adding $11$ to both sides of the congruence, we get $x+11\equiv 0\pmod{25}$.

10. Check the answer: The remainder when $x+11$ is divided by $25$ is $0$, which matches the original answer.

Answer: The answer is 0.



Question: Let $m$ be the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$. Find the remainder when $m$ is divided by $4!$.

Solution:
1. Understand the problem: We are given that $m$ is the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ (which is equal to $4\times3\times2\times1$) that are invertible modulo $4!$. We need to find the remainder when $m$ is divided by $4!$.

2. Apply basic number theory concepts: We know that an integer $a$ is invertible modulo $n$ if and only if $a$ is coprime to $n$. In other words, $\gcd(a,n) = 1$. 

3. Simplify expressions: The product of all positive integers less than $4!$ is $4!-1$. So, we need to find the remainder when $4!-1$ is divided by $4!$.

4. Solve congruences: To find the remainder when $4!-1$ is divided by $4!$, we can use the fact that $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ implies $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ for any positive integer $m$ that divides $n$. Therefore, we can find the remainder by subtracting $1$ from $4!$.

$4! - 1 = 24 - 1 = 23$

5. Study patterns and properties: There are no specific patterns or properties that can be applied in this problem.

6. Use prime factorization: We can find the prime factorization of $4!$ to simplify the calculations.

$4! = 4\times3\times2\times1 = 2^3\times3\times2\times1 = 2^3\times3\times2 = 2^4\times3$

7. Apply number theory theorems: There are no specific number theory theorems that can be applied in this problem.

8. Check for divisibility: We can check if $23$ is divisible by $4!$.

$23$ is not divisible by $4!$.

9. Solve step-by-step: We have already found the remainder when $4!-1$ is divided by $4!$, which is $23$.

10. Check the answer: The remainder $23$ satisfies the condition that $m$ is less than $4!$. Therefore, the answer is $23$.

Answer: The answer is 23.



Question: Find $2^{-1} \pmod{185}$, as a residue modulo 185.  (Give an answer between 0 and 184, inclusive.)

Solution:
1. Understand the problem: We are asked to find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185.

2. Apply basic number theory concepts: We know that the modular inverse of a number exists if the number and the modulus are coprime.

3. Simplify expressions: 2 and 185 are coprime, so the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185 exists.

4. Solve congruences: To find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 185, we need to find a number x such that $2x \equiv 1 \pmod{185}$.

5. Study patterns and properties: We can observe that $2^3 \equiv 8 \equiv -177 \pmod{185}$. This means that $2^3$ is congruent to -177 modulo 185.

6. Use prime factorization: We can use the prime factorization of 185 to simplify the calculations. The prime factorization of 185 is $5 \cdot 37$.

7. Apply number theory theorems: We can use Euler's totient function to find the modular inverse. Since 185 is not a prime number, we can use the formula $\phi(185) = (5-1)(37-1) = 144$.

8. Check for divisibility: We can check if 2 is divisible by 185, but it is not.

9. Solve step-by-step: We need to find a number x such that $2x \equiv 1 \pmod{185}$. We can rewrite this congruence as $2x \equiv 1 + 185y$, where y is an integer. 

10. Check the answer: We can check if the obtained answer satisfies the given conditions or requirements of the problem.

Answer: The answer is 93.
