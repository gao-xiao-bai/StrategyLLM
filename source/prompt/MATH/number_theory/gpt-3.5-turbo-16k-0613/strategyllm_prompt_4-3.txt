Question: Let $m$ be the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$. Find the remainder when $m$ is divided by $4!$.

Solution:
1. Identify the given problem and read it carefully.
   - The problem asks us to find the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$, and then find the remainder when this product is divided by $4!$.

2. Determine the key information and variables involved in the problem.
   - The key information is that we need to find the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$.
   - The variable involved is $m$, which represents this product.

3. Understand the specific modulo or residue being used in the problem.
   - The modulo being used is $4!$, which is equal to $24$.

4. Identify any congruence or inverse relationships in the problem.
   - In order for an integer $x$ to be invertible modulo $4!$, it must have a multiplicative inverse modulo $4!$.
   - This means that there exists an integer $y$ such that $xy \equiv 1 \pmod{4!}$.

5. Solve for the desired remainder, product, or inverse using the appropriate modular arithmetic techniques.
   - To find the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$, we need to find all the invertible integers and multiply them together.
   - Since $4! = 24$, we need to find all the positive integers less than $24$ that are invertible modulo $24$.
   - The invertible integers modulo $24$ are those that are coprime to $24$.
   - The positive integers less than $24$ that are coprime to $24$ are $1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23$.
   - Therefore, the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$ is $1 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17 \times 19 \times 23$.

6. Check the result to ensure it falls within the appropriate range or residue modulo.
   - The product $1 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17 \times 19 \times 23$ is a product of integers less than $24$, so it falls within the appropriate range.

7. If necessary, simplify the solution further by expressing it as a residue within the specified range.
   - The product $1 \times 5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17 \times 19 \times 23$ can be simplified as $1 \times (5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17 \times 19 \times 23)$.

8. Test the solution by substituting the result back into the original problem to verify its accuracy.
   - The remainder when $1 \times (5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17 \times 19 \times 23)$ is divided by $4!$ is equal to $1 \times (5 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17 \times 19 \times 23) \equiv 1 \pmod{24}$.

Answer: The answer is 1.
