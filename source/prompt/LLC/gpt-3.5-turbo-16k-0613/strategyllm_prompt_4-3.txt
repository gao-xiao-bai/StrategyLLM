Strategy:
Strategy to solve the last letter concatenation problem:

1. Read the input string.
2. Initialize an empty string to store the concatenation of the last letters.
3. Split the input string into individual words.
4. Iterate over each word in the split string.
5. Get the last letter of the current word.
6. Concatenate the last letter to the previously obtained concatenation string.
7. Repeat steps 5-6 for all words in the input string.
8. Print the final concatenation string as the answer.

Examples:
Question: Take the last letters of the words in "Elon Musk" and concatenate them.
Solution:
1. Read the input string.
   - Input: "Elon Musk"
2. Initialize an empty string to store the concatenation of the last letters.
   - Concatenation: ""
3. Split the input string into individual words.
   - Split: ["Elon", "Musk"]
4. Iterate over each word in the split string.
   - Current word: "Elon"
   - Current word: "Musk"
5. Get the last letter of the current word.
   - Last letter: "n"
   - Last letter: "k"
6. Concatenate the last letter to the previously obtained concatenation string.
   - Concatenation: "n"
   - Concatenation: "nk"
7. Repeat steps 5-6 for all words in the input string.
8. Print the final concatenation string as the answer.
   - Answer: "The answer is nk"

Answer: The answer is nk.



Question: Take the last letters of the words in "Larry Page" and concatenate them.
Solution:

3. Split the input string into individual words.
   - Split: ["Larry", "Page"]
4. Iterate over each word in the split string.
   - Current word: "Larry"
   - Current word: "Page"
5. Get the last letter of the current word.
   - Last letter: "y"
   - Last letter: "e"
6. Concatenate the last letter to the previously obtained concatenation string.
   - Concatenation: "y"
   - Concatenation: "ye"
7. Repeat steps 5-6 for all words in the input string.
8. Print the final concatenation string as the answer.
   - Answer: "The answer is ye"

Answer: The answer is ye.

   - Split: ["Sergey", "Brin"]
4. Iterate over each word in the split string.
   - Current word: "Sergey"
   - Current word: "Brin"
5. Get the last letter of the current word.
   - Last letter: "y"
   - Last letter: "n"
6. Concatenate the last letter to the previously obtained concatenation string.
   - Concatenation: "y"
   - Concatenation: "yn"
7. Repeat steps 5-6 for all words in the input string.
8. Print the final concatenation string as the answer.
   - Answer: "The answer is yn"

Answer: The answer is yn.
