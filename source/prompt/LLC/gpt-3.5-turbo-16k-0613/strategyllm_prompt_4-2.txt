Strategy:
1. Read the input phrase
2. Split the phrase into individual words
3. Initialize an empty string to store the last letters
4. Iterate through each word in the phrase
5. Get the last letter of the current word
6. Append the last letter to the string initialized in step 3
7. Output the final string of last letters

Examples:
Question: Take the last letters of the words in "Elon Musk" and concatenate them.
Solution:
1. Read the input phrase "Elon Musk"
2. Split the phrase into individual words: ["Elon", "Musk"]
3. Initialize an empty string to store the last letters: last_letters = ""
4. Iterate through each word in the phrase
   - For the word "Elon":
     - Get the last letter of the current word: last_letter = "n"
     - Append the last letter to the string initialized in step 3: last_letters = "n"
   - For the word "Musk":
     - Get the last letter of the current word: last_letter = "k"
     - Append the last letter to the string initialized in step 3: last_letters = "nk"
5. Output the final string of last letters: "nk"
Answer: The answer is nk.



Question: Take the last letters of the words in "Larry Page" and concatenate them.
Solution:
1. Read the input phrase: "Larry Page"
2. Split the phrase into individual words: ["Larry", "Page"]
3. Initialize an empty string to store the last letters: last_letters = ""
4. Iterate through each word in the phrase:
   - For the word "Larry":
     5. Get the last letter of the current word: last_letter = "y"
     6. Append the last letter to the string initialized in step 3: last_letters = "y"
   - For the word "Page":
     5. Get the last letter of the current word: last_letter = "e"
     6. Append the last letter to the string initialized in step 3: last_letters = "ye"
7. Output the final string of last letters

Answer: The answer is ye.

4. Iterate through each word in the phrase
   - For the word "Sergey":
     - Get the last letter of the current word: last_letter = "y"
     - Append the last letter to the string initialized in step 3: last_letters = "y"
   - For the word "Brin":
     - Get the last letter of the current word: last_letter = "n"
     - Append the last letter to the string initialized in step 3: last_letters = "yn"

Answer: The answer is yn.



Question: Take the last letters of the words in "Bill Gates" and concatenate them.
Solution:
1. Read the input phrase: "Bill Gates"
2. Split the phrase into individual words: ["Bill", "Gates"]

4. Iterate through each word in the phrase:
   - For the word "Bill":
     - Get the last letter of the current word: last_letter = "l"
     - Append the last letter to the string initialized in step 3: last_letters = "l"
   - For the word "Gates":
     - Get the last letter of the current word: last_letter = "s"
     - Append the last letter to the string initialized in step 3: last_letters = "ls"
