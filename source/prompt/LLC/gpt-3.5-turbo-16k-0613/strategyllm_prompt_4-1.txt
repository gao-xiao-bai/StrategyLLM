Strategy:
1. Identify the given input, which will be a string containing multiple words separated by spaces.
2. Split the input string into individual words.
3. Initialize an empty string to store the last letters of the words.
4. Iterate through each word in the list of words.
5. Get the last letter of each word.
6. Concatenate the last letter to the string from step 3.
7. Continue steps 4-6 until all words have been processed.
8. Print or return the final concatenated string.

Examples:
Question: Take the last letters of the words in "Elon Musk" and concatenate them.
Solution:
1. Identify the given input: "Elon Musk"
2. Split the input string into individual words: ["Elon", "Musk"]
3. Initialize an empty string: last_letters = ""
4. Iterate through each word in the list of words:
   - For the word "Elon":
     - Get the last letter: last_letter = "n"
     - Concatenate the last letter to last_letters: last_letters = "n"
   - For the word "Musk":
     - Get the last letter: last_letter = "k"
     - Concatenate the last letter to last_letters: last_letters = "nk"
5. Continue steps 4-6 until all words have been processed.
6. Print or return the final concatenated string: "nk"

Answer: The answer is nk.



Question: Take the last letters of the words in "Larry Page" and concatenate them.
Solution:
1. Identify the given input: "Larry Page"
2. Split the input string into individual words: ["Larry", "Page"]
3. Initialize an empty string: last_letters = ""
4. Iterate through each word in the list of words:
   - For the word "Larry":
     - Get the last letter: last_letter = "y"
     - Concatenate the last letter to the string: last_letters = "y"
   - For the word "Page":
     - Get the last letter: last_letter = "e"
     - Concatenate the last letter to the string: last_letters = "ye"
5. Continue steps 4-6 until all words have been processed.
6. Print or return the final concatenated string.

Answer: The answer is ye.



Question: Take the last letters of the words in "Sergey Brin" and concatenate them.
Solution:
1. Identify the given input: "Sergey Brin"
2. Split the input string into individual words: ["Sergey", "Brin"]
3. Initialize an empty string: last_letters = ""
4. Iterate through each word in the list of words:
   - For the word "Sergey":
     - Get the last letter: last_letter = "y"
     - Concatenate the last letter to the string: last_letters = "y"
   - For the word "Brin":
     - Get the last letter: last_letter = "n"
     - Concatenate the last letter to the string: last_letters = "yn"
5. Print or return the final concatenated string.

Answer: The answer is yn.



Question: Take the last letters of the words in "Bill Gates" and concatenate them.
Solution:
1. Identify the given input: "Bill Gates"
2. Split the input string into individual words: ["Bill", "Gates"]
3. Initialize an empty string: last_letters = ""
4. Iterate through each word in the list of words:
   - For the word "Bill":
     - Get the last letter: last_letter = "l"
     - Concatenate the last letter to last_letters: last_letters = "l"
   - For the word "Gates":
     - Get the last letter: last_letter = "s"
     - Concatenate the last letter to last_letters: last_letters = "ls"
5. Print or return the final concatenated string: "ls"

Answer: The answer is ls.
