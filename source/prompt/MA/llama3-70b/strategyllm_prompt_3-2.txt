Strategy:
Here is a strategy to solve multi-step arithmetic problems:

1. **Read the problem carefully**: Understand the given expression and identify the algebraic operations involved (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).
2. **Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS)**: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.
3. **Evaluate expressions inside parentheses**: Perform the operations inside each set of parentheses, working from the innermost to the outermost.
4. **Evaluate exponents (if any)**: Calculate any exponents (such as squaring or cubing) from left to right.
5. **Perform multiplication and division from left to right**: Evaluate any multiplication and division operations in the order they appear from left to right.
6. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**: Finally, evaluate any addition and subtraction operations in the order they appear from left to right.
7. **Combine terms (if necessary)**: Combine like terms (if any) to simplify the expression.
8. **Calculate the final answer**: Calculate the final answer by performing any remaining operations.

This strategy is general and concise, and it includes all necessary subtasks to solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Examples:
Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:

1. **Read the problem carefully**: Understand the given expression and identify the algebraic operations involved (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).

The expression is ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)).

2. **Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS)**: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

We will evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses first.

3. **Evaluate expressions inside parentheses**: Perform the operations inside each set of parentheses, working from the innermost to the outermost.

(-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = ?

9 * -4 = -36 (multiplication)

(-5 + -36 - 0) = -41 (addition and subtraction)

So, (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = -41.

Now, let's evaluate the second expression inside the parentheses:

(4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = ?

0 * -5 = 0 (multiplication)

(4 + -7 + 0) = -3 (addition and subtraction)

So, (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = -3.

4. **Evaluate exponents (if any)**: There are no exponents in this expression.

5. **Perform multiplication and division from left to right**: Multiply -41 and -3.

-41 * -3 = 123 (multiplication)

6. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**: There are no addition or subtraction operations left to perform.

7. **Combine terms (if necessary)**: There are no like terms to combine.

8. **Calculate the final answer**: The final answer is 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:

1. **Read the problem carefully**: Understand the given expression and identify the algebraic operations involved (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).

The expression involves multiplication, addition, and subtraction operations.

2. **Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS)**: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

We will evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses first.

3. **Evaluate expressions inside parentheses**: Perform the operations inside each set of parentheses, working from the innermost to the outermost.

Let's evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:

(-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ?

(-9 * 7) = -63
(-63 * 7) = -441
(-441 * -9) = 3969

So, (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = 3969.

Now, let's evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:

(4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = ?

(4 * -9) = -36
(-36 - 8) = -44
(-44 - -4) = -40

So, (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = -40.

4. **Evaluate exponents (if any)**: There are no exponents in this expression.

5. **Perform multiplication and division from left to right**: There are no multiplication or division operations outside the parentheses.

6. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**: Now, we will add the results of the two expressions inside the parentheses:

3969 + (-40) = 3929

7. **Combine terms (if necessary)**: There are no like terms to combine.

8. **Calculate the final answer**: The final answer is 3929.

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:

1. **Read the problem carefully**: Understand the given expression and identify the algebraic operations involved (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).

The expression is: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9))

2. **Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS)**: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right.

We will evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses first.

3. **Evaluate expressions inside parentheses**: Perform the operations inside each set of parentheses, working from the innermost to the outermost.

Let's evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:

(-3 + 5 * 8 * -4)

= (-3 + 5 * (-32))

= (-3 + (-160))

= (-163)

Now, let's evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:

(9 - 8 * -7 + -9)

= (9 - (-56) + -9)

= (9 + 56 - 9)

= 56

4. **Evaluate exponents (if any)**: There are no exponents in this expression.

5. **Perform multiplication and division from left to right**: There are no multiplication or division operations left to perform.

6. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right**: Now, we will subtract the two expressions:

(-163) - 56

= -219

7. **Combine terms (if necessary)**: There are no like terms to combine.

8. **Calculate the final answer**: The final answer is -219.

Answer: The answer is -219.
