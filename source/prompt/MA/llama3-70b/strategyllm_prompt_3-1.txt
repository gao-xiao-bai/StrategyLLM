Strategy:
Here is a strategy to solve multi-step arithmetic problems:

1. Break down the problem into smaller sub-expressions by identifying the parentheses and separate them.
2. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses, following the order of operations (PEMDAS):
   a. Calculate any exponents (none in these examples).
   b. Multiply and divide from left to right.
   c. Add and subtract from left to right.
3. Replace each evaluated sub-expression with its result in the original problem.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until there are no more parentheses.
5. Finally, evaluate the remaining expression following the order of operations (PEMDAS).

This strategy should help to solve multi-step arithmetic problems step by step, without being specific to any particular example.

Examples:
Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:

1. Break down the problem into smaller sub-expressions by identifying the parentheses and separate them:
   Expression 1: (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0)
   Expression 2: (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)

2. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses, following the order of operations (PEMDAS):
   a. Calculate any exponents (none in this example).
   b. Multiply and divide from left to right:
      Expression 1: 9 * -4 = -36
      Expression 2: 0 * -5 = 0
   c. Add and subtract from left to right:
      Expression 1: -5 + (-36) - 0 = -41
      Expression 2: 4 + (-7) + 0 = -3

3. Replace each evaluated sub-expression with its result in the original problem:
   ((-41) * (-3))

4. Repeat steps 2-3 until there are no more parentheses:
   a. Multiply and divide from left to right:
      (-41) * (-3) = 123

5. Finally, evaluate the remaining expression following the order of operations (PEMDAS):
   The final result is 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:

1. Break down the problem into smaller sub-expressions by identifying the parentheses and separate them:
   (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)

2. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses, following the order of operations (PEMDAS):

   a. Calculate any exponents (none in this example).
   b. Multiply and divide from left to right:
      (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = (-9 * 49 * -9) = (-9 * 441) = 3969
      (4 * -9) = -36
   c. Add and subtract from left to right:
      (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = (-36 - 8 + 4) = (-36 - 4) = -40

3. Replace each evaluated sub-expression with its result in the original problem:
   (3969) + (-40)

4. Repeat steps 2-3 until there are no more parentheses:
   (3969 + (-40)) = 3929

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:

1. Break down the problem into smaller sub-expressions by identifying the parentheses and separate them:
   Expression 1: (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4)
   Expression 2: (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)

2. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses, following the order of operations (PEMDAS):

   a. Calculate any exponents (none in this example).
   b. Multiply and divide from left to right:
      Expression 1: 5 * 8 * -4 = 5 * (-32) = -160
      Expression 2: 8 * -7 = -56
   c. Add and subtract from left to right:
      Expression 1: -3 + (-160) = -163
      Expression 2: 9 - (-56) + (-9) = 9 + 56 - 9 = 56

3. Replace each evaluated sub-expression with its result in the original problem:
   ((-163) - (56)) =

4. Repeat steps 2-3 until there are no more parentheses:
   a. Calculate any exponents (none in this example).
   b. Multiply and divide from left to right (none in this example).
   c. Add and subtract from left to right:
      (-163) - (56) = -219

Answer: The answer is -219.
