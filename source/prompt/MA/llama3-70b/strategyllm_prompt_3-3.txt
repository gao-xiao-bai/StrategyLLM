Strategy:
Here is a strategy to solve multi-step arithmetic problems:

1. **Parse the expression**: Break down the given expression into individual operations, grouping numbers and operators together.

2. **Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS)**: Evaluate the expression according to the order of operations: 
   - Evaluate any expressions inside parentheses
   - Exponentiation (if any)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

3. **Simplify each operation**: Perform each operation in the correct order, simplifying each result before moving on to the next operation.

4. **Combine intermediate results**: Combine the results of each operation to arrive at the final answer.

5. **Check and validate the answer**: Review the calculation to ensure accuracy and correctness.

This strategy is general, concise, and applicable to a wide range of multi-step arithmetic problems.

Examples:
Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:

**Step 1: Parse the expression**
Break down the given expression into individual operations, grouping numbers and operators together:

((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5))

**Step 2: Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS)**
Evaluate the expression according to the order of operations:

1. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses:
   - 9 * -4 = -36
   - 0 * -5 = 0

**Step 3: Simplify each operation**
Perform each operation in the correct order, simplifying each result before moving on to the next operation:

1. Evaluate the first parentheses:
   -5 + (-36) - 0 = -41
2. Evaluate the second parentheses:
   4 + (-7) + 0 = -3
3. Multiply the results of the two parentheses:
   (-41) * (-3) = 123

**Step 4: Combine intermediate results**
Combine the results of each operation to arrive at the final answer:
123

**Step 5: Check and validate the answer**
Review the calculation to ensure accuracy and correctness:
The calculation is correct, and the answer is 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:

**Step 1: Parse the expression**
Break down the given expression into individual operations, grouping numbers and operators together:

((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))

**Step 2: Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS)**
Evaluate the expression according to the order of operations:

1. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses:
   (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ?
   (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = ?

**Step 3: Simplify each operation**
Perform each operation in the correct order, simplifying each result before moving on to the next operation:

1. Evaluate (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9):
   -9 * 7 = -63
   -63 * 7 = -441
   -441 * -9 = 3969

2. Evaluate (4 * -9 - 8 - -4):
   4 * -9 = -36
   -36 - 8 = -44
   -44 - (-4) = -44 + 4 = -40

**Step 4: Combine intermediate results**
Combine the results of each operation to arrive at the final answer:

3969 + (-40) = 3969 - 40 = 3929

**Step 5: Check and validate the answer**
Review the calculation to ensure accuracy and correctness:

The calculation is correct, and the answer is indeed 3929.

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example based on the subtasks:

Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:

**Step 1: Parse the expression**

Break down the given expression into individual operations, grouping numbers and operators together:

((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9))

**Step 2: Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS)**

Evaluate the expression according to the order of operations:

1. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses:
   - 5 * 8 * -4 = 5 * (-32) = -160
   - 8 * -7 = -56

2. Simplify each operation:
   - (-3 + (-160)) = -163
   - (9 - (-56) + (-9)) = 9 + 56 - 9 = 56

**Step 3: Simplify each operation**

Perform each operation in the correct order, simplifying each result before moving on to the next operation:

(-163) - 56 = -219

**Step 4: Combine intermediate results**

Combine the results of each operation to arrive at the final answer:

-219

**Step 5: Check and validate the answer**

Review the calculation to ensure accuracy and correctness:

The calculation is correct, and the answer is -219.

Answer: The answer is -219.
