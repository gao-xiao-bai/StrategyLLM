Strategy:
To solve multi-step arithmetic problems, we can follow this strategy:

1. Parse the input expression into a list of operands and operators.
2. Identify the order of operations (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).
3. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses recursively.
4. Evaluate exponents.
5. Perform multiplication and division operations from left to right.
6. Perform addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
7. Return the final result.

Here's an explanation of each subtask:

1. Parse the input expression: Convert the input string into a list of operands (numbers) and operators (+, -, *, /, ^).
2. Identify the order of operations: Follow the PEMDAS rule to determine the order in which operations should be performed.
3. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses: Recursively evaluate expressions inside parentheses by applying the same strategy.
4. Evaluate exponents: Calculate the values of expressions involving exponents.
5. Perform multiplication and division: Evaluate multiplication and division operations from left to right, giving them higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
6. Perform addition and subtraction: Evaluate addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
7. Return the final result: After performing all operations, return the final result.

By following this strategy, we can solve multi-step arithmetic problems involving various operations and nested parentheses.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:
1. Parse the input expression:
   Operands: -5, 9, -4, 0, 4, -7, 0, -5
   Operators: +, *, -, *, +, -, *, ()

2. Identify the order of operations (PEMDAS):
   Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, then exponents, multiplication/division (left to right), and addition/subtraction (left to right).

3. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses:
   (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 - 36) = -41
   (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 - 7) = -3

4. Evaluate exponents:
   No exponents in this expression.

5. Perform multiplication and division:
   (-41) * (-3) = 123

6. Perform addition and subtraction:
   No more addition or subtraction operations.

7. Return the final result:
   The final result is 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:
1. Parse the input expression:
   Operands: -9, 7, 7, -9, 4, -9, -8, -4
   Operators: *, *, *, +, *, -, -, -

2. Identify the order of operations (PEMDAS):
   Parentheses: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9), (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))
   Exponents: None
   Multiplication/Division: -9 * 7 * 7 * -9, 4 * -9
   Addition/Subtraction: 4 * -9 - 8 - -4, (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)

3. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses:
   (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = -9 * 7 * 7 * -9 = -9 * 49 * -9 = 3969
   (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = 4 * -9 - 8 + 4 = -36 - 8 + 4 = -40

4. Evaluate exponents: None

5. Perform multiplication and division:
   Already done in step 3.

6. Perform addition and subtraction:
   3969 + (-40) = 3929

7. Return the final result: 3929

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:
1. Parse the input expression:
   Operands: -3, 5, 8, -4, 9, 8, -7, -9
   Operators: +, *, *, -, -, *, +, -

2. Identify the order of operations (PEMDAS):
   Parentheses: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4), (9 - 8 * -7 + -9))
   Exponents: None
   Multiplication/Division: 5 * 8 * -4, 8 * -7
   Addition/Subtraction: -3 + (5 * 8 * -4), 9 - (8 * -7) + -9, ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9))

3. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses:
   5 * 8 * -4 = -160
   -3 + -160 = -163
   8 * -7 = -56
   9 - (-56) + -9 = 56

4. Evaluate exponents: None

5. Perform multiplication and division: Already done in step 3.

6. Perform addition and subtraction:
   -163 - 56 = -219

7. Return the final result: -219

Answer: The answer is -219.
