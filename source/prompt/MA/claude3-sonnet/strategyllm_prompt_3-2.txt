Strategy:
1. Parse the given arithmetic expression into a structured representation, such as a tree or a list of tokens.
2. Evaluate the expression by following the order of operations (PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).
3. Perform the specified arithmetic operations on the operands, following the structure of the expression.
4. Recursively evaluate any nested expressions within parentheses.
5. Apply the appropriate arithmetic operations in the correct order, following PEMDAS.
6. Simplify the expression and obtain the final result.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:
1. Parse the given arithmetic expression into a structured representation:
   ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5))

2. Evaluate the expression by following the order of operations (PEMDAS):
   a. Evaluate the innermost parentheses: 9 * -4 = -36
   b. Evaluate the first set of parentheses: (-5 + -36 - 0) = -41
   c. Evaluate the second set of parentheses: (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = -3
   d. Evaluate the outer parentheses: (-41 * -3) = 123

3. Simplify the expression and obtain the final result: 123

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:
1. Parse the given arithmetic expression into a structured representation:
   ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))

2. Evaluate the expression by following the order of operations (PEMDAS):
   a. Evaluate the innermost parentheses: (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = (-9 * 49 * -9) = 3969
   b. Evaluate the innermost parentheses: (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = (-36 - 8 + 4) = -40
   c. Combine the evaluated expressions: 3969 + (-40) = 3929

3. Simplify the expression and obtain the final result: 3929

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:
1. Parse the given arithmetic expression into a structured representation:
   ((-3 + (5 * 8 * -4)) - (9 - (8 * -7) + -9))

2. Evaluate the expression by following the order of operations (PEMDAS):
   a. Evaluate the innermost parentheses: (5 * 8 * -4) = -160
   b. Evaluate the next parentheses: (8 * -7) = -56
   c. Evaluate the remaining parentheses: (-3 + -160) = -163
   d. Evaluate the remaining parentheses: (9 - -56 + -9) = 56
   e. Evaluate the outermost parentheses: (-163 - 56) = -219

3. Simplify the expression and obtain the final result: -219

Answer: The answer is -219.
