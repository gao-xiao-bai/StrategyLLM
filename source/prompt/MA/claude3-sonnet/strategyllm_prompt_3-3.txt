Strategy:
To solve multi-step arithmetic problems, we can follow this strategy:

1. Parse the given expression by identifying the individual operations and their order of precedence.
2. Evaluate the innermost parentheses by performing the operations within them, following the order of operations (PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).
3. Simplify the expression by substituting the result from step 2 and removing the evaluated parentheses.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all parentheses are evaluated.
5. Evaluate the remaining operations in the expression from left to right, following the order of operations.
6. Simplify the final result.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:
1. Parse the given expression:
   ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5))
   The expression has two sets of parentheses, and the operations within each set need to be evaluated first.

2. Evaluate the innermost parentheses:
   (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 - 36) = -41
   (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + (-7) + 0) = (4 - 7) = -3

3. Simplify the expression by substituting the results from step 2:
   (-41 * -3)

4. Evaluate the remaining operation:
   (-41 * -3) = (-41 * -3) = 123

5. Simplify the final result:
   123

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:
1. Parse the given expression:
   ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))
   There are two sets of parentheses, and the operations within each set need to be evaluated first.

2. Evaluate the innermost parentheses:
   (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = (-9 * 49 * -9) = 3969
   (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = (-36 - 8 + 4) = -40

3. Simplify the expression by substituting the results:
   (3969 + (-40))

4. Evaluate the remaining operations:
   3969 + (-40) = 3969 - 40 = 3929

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:
1. Parse the given expression:
   ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9))
   Innermost parentheses: (5 * 8 * -4), (8 * -7), (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)

2. Evaluate the innermost parentheses:
   (5 * 8 * -4) = -160
   (8 * -7) = -56
   (9 - (-56) + -9) = 9 + 56 - 9 = 56

3. Simplify the expression by substituting the results:
   ((-3 + -160) - 56)

4. Evaluate the remaining parentheses:
   (-3 + -160) = -163

5. Evaluate the remaining operations:
   (-163 - 56) = -219

6. Simplify the final result:
   -219

Answer: The answer is -219.
