Strategy:
1. Identify the innermost operations enclosed in parentheses.
2. Evaluate the innermost operations first.
3. Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all parentheses are removed.
5. Evaluate the remaining arithmetic operations according to the order of operations (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).
6. Evaluate all multiplication and division operations from left to right.
7. Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 until there are no more multiplication and division operations to be performed.
9. Evaluate all addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
10. Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
11. Repeat steps 9-10 until there are no more addition and subtraction operations to be performed.
12. The final result is the solution to the multi-step arithmetic problem.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the innermost operations enclosed in parentheses.
The innermost operation is 9 * -4.

Step 2: Evaluate the innermost operations first.
9 * -4 = -36

Step 3: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
((-5 + -36 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5))

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until all parentheses are removed.
The innermost operation is 0 * -5.

Step 5: Evaluate the innermost operations first.
0 * -5 = 0

Step 6: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
((-5 + -36 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0))

Step 7: Repeat steps 1-3 until all parentheses are removed.
The innermost operation is -5 + -36 - 0.

Step 8: Evaluate the innermost operations first.
-5 + -36 - 0 = -41

Step 9: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
((-41) * (4 + -7 + 0))

Step 10: Repeat steps 1-3 until all parentheses are removed.
The innermost operation is 4 + -7 + 0.

Step 11: Evaluate the innermost operations first.
4 + -7 + 0 = -3

Step 12: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
((-41) * (-3))

Step 13: Repeat steps 1-3 until all parentheses are removed.
There are no more parentheses.

Step 14: Evaluate all multiplication and division operations from left to right.
(-41) * (-3) = 123

Step 15: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
123

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the innermost operations enclosed in parentheses.
The innermost operation is (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).

Step 2: Evaluate the innermost operations first.
4 * -9 = -36
-36 - 8 = -44
-44 - -4 = -40

Step 3: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
(((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + -40)

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until all parentheses are removed.
The innermost operation is (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9).

Step 5: Evaluate the innermost operations first.
-9 * 7 = -63
-63 * 7 = -441
-441 * -9 = 3969

Step 6: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
(3969 + -40)

Step 7: Repeat steps 5-6 until there are no more multiplication and division operations to be performed.
There are no more multiplication and division operations to be performed.

Step 8: Evaluate all addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
3969 + -40 = 3929

Step 9: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
The answer is 3929.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the innermost operations enclosed in parentheses.
The innermost operations are (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).

Step 2: Evaluate the innermost operations first.
(-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + 40 * -4) = (-3 + -160) = -163
(9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = (9 + 56 + -9) = 56

Step 3: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
(((-163) - (56)) = (-163 - 56)

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until all parentheses are removed.
There are no more parentheses.

Step 5: Evaluate the remaining arithmetic operations according to the order of operations (multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).
Step 6: Evaluate all multiplication and division operations from left to right.
(-163 - 56) = -219

Step 7: Replace the evaluated expression with the result.
The answer is -219.
