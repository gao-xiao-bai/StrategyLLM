Strategy:
1. Identify the innermost parentheses in the expression.
2. Evaluate the arithmetic operation within the innermost parentheses.
3. Replace the innermost parentheses with the result of the arithmetic operation.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more parentheses left in the expression.
5. Evaluate any remaining arithmetic operations from left to right.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the innermost parentheses in the expression.
The innermost parentheses is (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0).

Step 2: Evaluate the arithmetic operation within the innermost parentheses.
(-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.

Step 3: Replace the innermost parentheses with the result of the arithmetic operation.
(((-41) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)).

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more parentheses left in the expression.
The innermost parentheses is (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).

Step 2: Evaluate the arithmetic operation within the innermost parentheses.
(4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + 0) = -3.

Step 3: Replace the innermost parentheses with the result of the arithmetic operation.
(((-41) * (-3)).

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more parentheses left in the expression.
There are no more parentheses left in the expression.

Step 5: Evaluate any remaining arithmetic operations from left to right.
((-41) * (-3)) = 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the innermost parentheses in the expression.
The innermost parentheses is (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).

Step 2: Evaluate the arithmetic operation within the innermost parentheses.
4 * -9 = -36
-36 - 8 = -44
-44 - -4 = -40

Step 3: Replace the innermost parentheses with the result of the arithmetic operation.
(((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + -40))

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more parentheses left in the expression.
There are no more parentheses left in the expression.

Step 5: Evaluate any remaining arithmetic operations from left to right.
-9 * 7 = -63
-63 * 7 = -441
-441 * -9 = 3969
3969 + -40 = 3929

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
Solution:
Step 1: Identify the innermost parentheses in the expression.
The innermost parentheses is (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).

Step 2: Evaluate the arithmetic operation within the innermost parentheses.
For (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4):
-3 + 5 * 8 * -4 = -3 + 40 * -4 = -3 + (-160) = -163

For (9 - 8 * -7 + -9):
9 - 8 * -7 + -9 = 9 - (-56) + (-9) = 9 + 56 - 9 = 56

Step 3: Replace the innermost parentheses with the result of the arithmetic operation.
(((-163) - 56))

Step 4: Repeat steps 1-3 until there are no more parentheses left in the expression.
There are no more parentheses left in the expression.

Step 5: Evaluate any remaining arithmetic operations from left to right.
-163 - 56 = -219

Answer: The answer is -219.
