Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
Solution: 
Step 1: Identify the arithmetic expression in the question.
The arithmetic expression in the question is ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)).

Step 2: Simplify the given expression by performing the arithmetic operations in the correct order of operations.
First, we need to simplify the innermost parentheses.

Step 3: Break down the expression into smaller sub-expressions.
Sub-expression 1: -5 + 9 * -4 - 0
Sub-expression 2: 4 + -7 + 0 * -5

Step 4: Solve each sub-expression separately and keep track of the intermediate results.
Sub-expression 1: -5 + 9 * -4 - 0
   = -5 + (-36) - 0
   = -5 - 36
   = -41

Sub-expression 2: 4 + -7 + 0 * -5
   = 4 + (-7) + 0
   = 4 - 7
   = -3

Step 5: Combine the intermediate results to find the final answer.
(((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) = (-41 * -3)

Step 6: Pay attention to the signs and perform the operations accurately.
(-41 * -3) = 123

Step 7: Use parentheses to group the terms and ensure the correct order of operations.
(((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) = 123

Step 8: Handle negative numbers carefully while multiplying or subtracting.
No negative numbers in this step.

Step 9: Double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.
((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) = 123

Step 10: Verify the final result with the given answer in the question.
The answer is 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
Solution: 
Step 1: Identify the arithmetic expression in the question.
The arithmetic expression in the question is ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)).

Step 2: Simplify the given expression by performing the arithmetic operations in the correct order of operations.
First, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses.

Step 3: Break down the expression into smaller sub-expressions.
Sub-expression 1: -9 * 7 * 7 * -9
Sub-expression 2: 4 * -9
Sub-expression 3: -8
Sub-expression 4: -(-4)

Step 4: Solve each sub-expression separately and keep track of the intermediate results.
Sub-expression 1: -9 * 7 * 7 * -9 = -3969
Sub-expression 2: 4 * -9 = -36
Sub-expression 3: -8 = -8
Sub-expression 4: -(-4) = 4

Step 5: Combine the intermediate results to find the final answer.
((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) = (-3969 + (-36 - 8 + 4))

Step 6: Pay attention to the signs and perform the operations accurately.
((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) = (-3969 + (-36 - 8 + 4)) = (-3969 + (-40 + 4))

Step 7: Use parentheses to group the terms and ensure the correct order of operations.
((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) = (-3969 + (-40 + 4)) = (-3969 + (-36))

Step 8: Handle negative numbers carefully while multiplying or subtracting.
((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) = (-3969 + (-36)) = -4005

Step 9: Double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.
((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) = -4005

Step 10: Verify the final result with the given answer in the question.
The answer is 3929.

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
Solution: 
Step 1: Identify the arithmetic expression in the question.
The arithmetic expression in the question is ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)).

Step 2: Simplify the given expression by performing the arithmetic operations in the correct order of operations.
Step 3: Break down the expression into smaller sub-expressions.
Sub-expression 1: -3 + 5 * 8 * -4
Sub-expression 2: 9 - 8 * -7 + -9

Step 4: Solve each sub-expression separately and keep track of the intermediate results.
Sub-expression 1: -3 + 5 * 8 * -4
   - Multiply 5 * 8 = 40
   - Multiply 40 * -4 = -160
   - Add -3 + (-160) = -163

Sub-expression 2: 9 - 8 * -7 + -9
   - Multiply 8 * -7 = -56
   - Add 9 + (-56) = -47
   - Add -47 + (-9) = -56

Step 5: Combine the intermediate results to find the final answer.
Final expression: (-163) - (-56)
   - Subtract -56 from -163 = -107

Answer: The answer is -219.
