Strategy:
1. Extract the arithmetic expression from the input.
2. Parse the expression to identify the operators and operands.
3. Prioritize the operators based on the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).
4. Perform operations inside parentheses first, if any.
5. Calculate exponents, if any.
6. Perform multiplication and division operations from left to right.
7. Perform addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
8. Continue evaluating the expression according to the above rules until no operators remain in the expression.
9. Return the final result as the answer.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:
1. Extract the arithmetic expression from the input: (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)
2. Parse the expression to identify the operators and operands:
   Operators: +, *, -
   Operands: -5, 9, -4, 0, 4, -7, 0, -5
3. Prioritize the operators based on the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
   Parentheses: (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0), (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)
   Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 9 * -4, 0 * -5
   Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): -5 + -36, -3 + -7, -40 + 0
4. Perform operations inside parentheses first:
   (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -41
   (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (-3 + 0) = -3
5. Calculate exponents, if any (there are no exponents in this example).
6. Perform multiplication and division operations from left to right:
   9 * -4 = -36
   0 * -5 = 0
7. Perform addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
   -5 + -36 = -41
   -3 + 0 = -3
8. Continue evaluating the expression according to the above rules until no operators remain in the expression:
   (-41) * (-3) = 123
9. Return the final result as the answer: 123

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:
1. Extract the arithmetic expression: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))
2. Parse the expression to identify the operators and operands:
   - Operators: *, +, -
   - Operands: -9, 7, 4, 8
3. Prioritize the operators based on the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
   - Parentheses: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))
   - Exponents: None
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right): -9 * 7 * 7 * -9, 4 * -9
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)
4. Perform operations inside parentheses first:
   - Calculate -9 * 7 * 7 * -9:
      - First, multiply -9 and 7: -63
      - Then, multiply the result by 7: -441
      - Finally, multiply the result by -9: 3969
   - Calculate 4 * -9: -36
   - Calculate 4 * -9 - 8 - -4:
      - First, multiply 4 and -9: -36
      - Then, subtract 8 from the result: -44
      - Finally, add -4 to the result: -40
5. Perform addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
   - Add the results from step 4: 3969 + (-40) = 3929

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:
1. Extract the arithmetic expression from the input: (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)
2. Parse the expression to identify the operators and operands:
   - Operators: +, *, -
   - Operands: -3, 5, 8, -4, 9, -7, -9
3. Prioritize the operators based on the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
   - Parentheses: (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4), (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right): 5 * 8 * -4, 8 * -7
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right): -3 + (result of 5 * 8 * -4), 9 - (result of 8 * -7) + -9
4. Perform operations inside parentheses first:
   - (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4):
      - Calculate 5 * 8 * -4: 5 * 8 = 40, 40 * -4 = -160
      - Add -3 to the result: -3 + (-160) = -163
   - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9):
      - Calculate 8 * -7: 8 * -7 = -56
      - Subtract the result from 9: 9 - (-56) = 65
      - Add -9 to the result: 65 + (-9) = 56
5. Perform multiplication and division operations from left to right:
   - 5 * 8 * -4: 5 * 8 = 40, 40 * -4 = -160
   - 8 * -7: 8 * -7 = -56
6. Perform addition and subtraction operations from left to right:
   - -3 + (-160): -3 - 160 = -163
   - 9 - (-56) + -9: 9 + 56 - 9 = 56
7. Continue evaluating the expression according to the above rules:
   - (-163) - 56: -163 - 56 = -219
8. Return the final result as the answer: -219

Answer: The answer is -219.
