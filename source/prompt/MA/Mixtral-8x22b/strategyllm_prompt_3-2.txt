Strategy:
1. Identify the given arithmetic problem.
2. Determine the order of operations in the problem (PEMDAS/BODMAS). This means solving operations inside Parentheses first, followed by Exponents/Orders (squaring and square roots, etc.), Multiplication and Division from left to right, and Addition and Subtraction from left to right.
3. Break down the problem into smaller parts, based on the order of operations. Group operations to be performed together.
4. Calculate the value of each smaller part incrementally, moving step-by-step from the innermost parentheses outwards.
5. Keep solving for each part of the problem, upholding the order of operations, removing parentheses and simplifying the problem further.
6. Continue until the entire problem has been solved. If the problem is long or complex, it may require several rounds of simplification.
7. Finalize the answer and check the answer for any calculation or interpretation errors.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:
1. Identify the given arithmetic problem: The given arithmetic problem is ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)).
2. Determine the order of operations: According to PEMDAS/BODMAS, we need to solve operations inside Parentheses first, followed by Multiplication and Division from left to right, and Addition and Subtraction from left to right.
3. Break down the problem into smaller parts:
   - First, solve the multiplication inside the first parentheses: 9 * -4 = -36.
   - Next, solve the addition and subtraction inside the first parentheses: -5 + (-36) - 0 = -41.
   - Then, solve the multiplication inside the second parentheses: 0 * -5 = 0.
   - Finally, solve the addition and subtraction inside the second parentheses: 4 + (-7) + 0 = -3.
4. Calculate the value of each smaller part incrementally:
   - The value inside the first parentheses is -41.
   - The value inside the second parentheses is -3.
5. Keep solving for each part of the problem:
   - Multiply the values from the first and second parentheses: -41 * -3 = 123.
6. Continue until the entire problem has been solved: The entire problem has been solved in the previous step.
7. Finalize the answer and check for any calculation or interpretation errors: The final answer is 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:
1. Identify the given arithmetic problem: The problem is ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)).
2. Determine the order of operations: According to PEMDAS/BODMAS, we need to solve operations inside Parentheses first, followed by Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, and Addition and Subtraction from left to right.
3. Break down the problem into smaller parts:
   - First, solve the multiplication inside the first parentheses: (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9).
   - Second, solve the multiplication and subtraction inside the second parentheses: (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
4. Calculate the value of each smaller part:
   - For the first part: (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = 441 * -9 = -3969.
   - For the second part: (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = (-36 - 8 + 4) = -40.
5. Solve for the entire problem:
   - Now, add the results of the two parts: -3969 + (-40) = -3969 - 40 = -4009.
6. Finalize the answer: The answer is -4009.

Answer: The answer is -4009.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:
1. Identify the given arithmetic problem: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9))
2. Determine the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
   - Parentheses: (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)
   - Multiplication: 5 * 8 * -4 and 8 * -7
   - Addition and Subtraction: -3 + (result of multiplication), 9 - (result of multiplication), and (result of first parentheses) - (result of second parentheses)
3. Break down the problem into smaller parts:
   - First parentheses: -3 + 5 * 8 * -4
     - Multiplication: 5 * 8 * -4 = 40 * -4 = -160
     - Addition: -3 + (-160) = -163
   - Second parentheses: 9 - 8 * -7 + -9
     - Multiplication: 8 * -7 = -56
     - Subtraction: 9 - (-56) = 9 + 56 = 65
     - Addition: 65 + (-9) = 56
4. Calculate the value of each smaller part incrementally:
   - First parentheses: -163
   - Second parentheses: 56
5. Solve for the entire problem:
   - Subtraction: -163 - 56 = -219

Answer: The answer is -219.
