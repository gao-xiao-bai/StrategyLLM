Strategy:
1. Start by identifying and understanding the arithmetic problem given in the question.
2. Break down the problem into smaller arithmetic operations according to the order of operations, also known as BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS rule (Brackets/Orders/Division/Multiplication/Addition/Subtraction).
3. Begin with the operations within brackets. If there are nested brackets, start with the innermost one. 
4. If any operation involves exponentiation (indicated by "Orders" in BIDMAS), solve this next.
5. Perform any division or multiplication operations next. These should be performed as encountered from left to right.
6. Lastly, carry out any addition or subtraction operations, again from left to right.
7. Repeat the process of BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS for each bracket or subsequence until the entire arithmetic problem has been addressed.
8. Once all operations have been carried out, conclude with the final answer.
9. Express the answer in the required format as mentioned in the question.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution: 
1. Identify the arithmetic problem: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5))
2. Break down the problem according to BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS rule.
3. Start with the operations within brackets.
   - For the first bracket, (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0), perform multiplication first: 9 * -4 = -36. So, the expression becomes (-5 + -36 - 0).
   - Then perform addition and subtraction from left to right: -5 + -36 = -41, and -41 - 0 = -41.
   - So, the first bracket simplifies to -41.
   - For the second bracket, (4 + -7 + 0 * -5), perform multiplication first: 0 * -5 = 0. So, the expression becomes (4 + -7 + 0).
   - Then perform addition and subtraction from left to right: 4 + -7 = -3, and -3 + 0 = -3.
   - So, the second bracket simplifies to -3.
4. The problem now becomes (-41 * -3).
5. Perform the multiplication: -41 * -3 = 123.
6. So, the final answer is 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution: 
1. Identify the arithmetic problem: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))
2. Break down the problem according to BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS rule.
3. Start with the operations within brackets.
   - First bracket: (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9)
     - Multiply -9 and 7 to get -63.
     - Multiply -63 and 7 to get -441.
     - Multiply -441 and -9 to get 3969.
   - Second bracket: (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)
     - Multiply 4 and -9 to get -36.
     - Subtract 8 from -36 to get -44.
     - Subtract -4 from -44 to get -40.
4. There are no exponentiation operations in this problem.
5. There are no division operations in this problem.
6. Perform the addition operation: 3969 + -40 = 3929.
7. There are no more operations to perform.
8. The final answer is 3929.

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution: 
1. Identify the arithmetic problem: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9))
2. Break down the problem according to BIDMAS/BODMAS/PEDMAS rule.
3. Start with the operations within brackets.
   - For the first bracket (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4):
     - Perform multiplication first: 5 * 8 = 40 and 40 * -4 = -160
     - Then perform addition: -3 + -160 = -163
   - For the second bracket (9 - 8 * -7 + -9):
     - Perform multiplication first: 8 * -7 = -56
     - Then perform addition and subtraction from left to right: 9 - -56 = 65 and 65 + -9 = 56
4. There are no exponentiation operations in this problem.
5. There are no division operations in this problem.
6. Perform the subtraction operation: -163 - 56 = -219
7. The entire arithmetic problem has been addressed.
8. The final answer is -219.

Answer: The answer is -219.
