Strategy:
1. Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) by first performing calculations inside parentheses.
2. Calculate any exemptions to the order of operations, such as exponentiation.
3. Perform multiplication and division from left to right.
4. Perform addition and subtraction from left to right.
5. Ensure all necessary calculations are done and confirm the final answer.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:
1. Calculate the expressions in the parentheses from left to right.
   Start with (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0). First, calculate 9 * -4 which equals -36.
   The new expression is now: (-5 - 36 - 0).
   Then, calculate -5 - 36 which equals -41. The expression is now: (-41 - 0).
   Finally, calculate -41 - 0 which equals -41.

2. Now, calculate the expression in the second parentheses: (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
   First, calculate 0 * -5 which equals 0.
   The new expression is now: (4 + -7 + 0).
   Then, calculate 4 + -7 which equals -3. The expression is now: (-3).

3. The question now is: (-41) * (-3).
   Multiply -41 and -3, which equals 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:
1. First, perform calculations inside the parentheses. 
   (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = (-9 * 7 * 49) = (-441 * -9) = 3969
   (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = (-36 - 8 + 4) = (-44 + 4) = -40

2. Now, add the results from step 1.
   3969 + (-40) = 3929

Answer: The answer is 3929.
