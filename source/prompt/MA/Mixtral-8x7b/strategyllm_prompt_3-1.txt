Strategy:
1. Follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to ensure the correct calculation of the arithmetic expression. 
	* Parentheses/Brackets
	* Exponents/Orders
	* Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
	* Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
2. Within each operation group, solve arithmetic operations from left to right.
3. Simplify expressions inside parentheses or brackets first, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) as in step 1.
4. Perform calculations with integers according to their signs:
	* Addition: combine the numbers with the same sign, then perform the addition of the results (positive + positive = positive; negative + negative = negative)
	* Subtraction: if there is a minus sign in front of the numbers with the same sign, change the sign of the following numbers and perform the addition (negative - positive = negative; positive - negative = positive)
	* Multiplication: combine the numbers with the same sign, then perform the multiplication of the results (positive * positive = positive; negative * negative = positive)
	* Division: if there is a minus sign in front of the numbers with the same sign, change the sign of the following numbers and perform the division of the results (negative / positive = negative; positive / negative = negative)
5. Calculate the results of each operation group in the order specified in step 1.

Examples:
Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:
1. First, we handle the operations inside the parentheses. We start with the expression (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0). According to PEMDAS/BODMAS, we should perform multiplication before addition and subtraction. So, we calculate 9 * -4 = -36.
   The expression becomes: (-5 - 36 - 0)

2. Next, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. We calculate -5 - 36 = -41 and (-41 - 0) = -41.
   The expression is now simplified to: -41

3. Now, we handle the second parentheses: (4 + -7 + 0 * -5). Again, we calculate multiplication first, which is 0 * -5 = 0.
   The expression becomes: (4 + -7 + 0)

4. Then, we perform addition and subtraction from left to right. We calculate 4 + -7 = -3 and (-3 + 0) = -3.
   The expression is now simplified to: -3

5. Lastly, we perform the multiplication between the two results we got from the parentheses: -41 * -3.
   We calculate -41 * -3 = 123.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:
1. First, we handle the operations inside the parentheses. 
   For the left parentheses:
   -9 * 7 * 7 * -9
   We follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
   Multiply: 
   (-9) * 7 = -63
   (-63) * 7 = -441
   (-441) * -9 = 3969

   For the right parentheses:
   (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)
   We follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
   Multiply:
   4 * -9 = -36

   Then, we perform subtraction:
   -36 - 8 = -44
   -44 - (-4) = -40

2. Now, we have:
   (3969) + (-40)

3. Finally, we perform addition:
   3969 + (-40) = 3929

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:
1. First, we handle the operations inside the parentheses, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

   a. Inside the first parentheses, we have (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4). We start by performing the multiplication:
   i. 5 * 8 * -4 = -160
   ii. Now, replace the multiplication part of the expression: (-3 + -160)
   iii. Next, perform the addition: -3 + -160 = -163

   b. Inside the second parentheses, we have (9 - 8 * -7 + -9). We start by performing the multiplication:
   i. 8 * -7 = -56
   ii. Now, replace the multiplication part of the expression: (9 - -56 + -9)
   iii. Next, perform the subtraction and addition from left to right: 9 - -56 = 9 + 56 = 65, then 65 + -9 = 56

2. Now, replace the parentheses expressions with their calculated values:
   i. (-163) - (56)

3. Finally, perform the subtraction:
   i. -163 - 56 = -219

Answer: The answer is -219.
