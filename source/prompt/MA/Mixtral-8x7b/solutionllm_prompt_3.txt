Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution: First, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), which means we perform calculations in the following order: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

First, we evaluate the expression inside the first parentheses:

-5 + 9 * -4 - 0

We start by performing the multiplication:

-5 + 36 - 0

Then, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

31

Next, we evaluate the expression inside the second parentheses:

4 + -7 + 0 * -5

We start by performing the multiplication:

4 + -7 + 0

Then, we do addition and subtraction from left to right:

-3

Finally, we multiply the results of the two parentheses expressions:

31 * -3

Which gives us the answer:

-93

Answer: The answer is -93.



Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4))
Solution: First, perform the multiplication operations:
(-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = (3969) and (4 * -9) = (-36)

Next, perform the addition and subtraction operations inside the second parentheses:
(-36 - 8 - -4) = (-28 - -4) = (-24)

Finally, add the two results:
(3969 + -24) = 3945

Answer: The answer is 3945.



Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution: First, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) to solve the expressions inside the parentheses. 

For the left expression: (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4), we should perform multiplication first:

= (-3 + 5 * 64 * -4)
= (-3 + 320 * -4)

Now, we perform multiplication:

= (-3 + -1280)
= -1283

For the right expression: (9 - 8 * -7 + -9), we should perform multiplication first:

= (9 - 8 * 7 + -9)
= (9 - 56 + -9)

Now, we perform subtraction and addition from left to right:

= (-47 + -9)
= -56

So, the original expression becomes: (-1283) - (-56). We perform subtraction:

= -1283 + 56
= -1227

Answer: The answer is -1227.
