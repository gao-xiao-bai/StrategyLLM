Strategy:
Here is a strategy to solve multi-step arithmetic problems:

1. **Evaluate the expression inside each pair of parentheses first**: Start by evaluating the expressions inside each pair of parentheses, following the order of operations (PEMDAS). For example, if you have the expression `((a + 2) * 3)`, first calculate `a + 2` and then multiply the result by 3.

2. **Simplify each expression outside the parentheses**: Once you have evaluated the expressions inside the parentheses, simplify each expression outside the parentheses by performing any necessary arithmetic operations, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing.

3. **Combine like terms**: If the expression contains like terms (e.g., multiple terms with the same variable), combine them by adding or subtracting the coefficients.

4. **Perform any necessary simplifications**: After combining like terms, perform any necessary simplifications, such as canceling out common factors or reducing fractions.

5. **Evaluate the final expression**: Finally, evaluate the final expression to get the answer.

This strategy can be applied to solve multi-step arithmetic problems, including those with multiple sets of parentheses and complex arithmetic operations.

Examples:
Here is the step-by-step solution to the example:

Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside each pair of parentheses first

(-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = ? (evaluate the expression inside the first pair of parentheses)
9 * -4 = -36
-5 + -36 - 0 = -41

(4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = ? (evaluate the expression inside the second pair of parentheses)
0 * -5 = 0
4 + -7 + 0 = -3

Step 2: Simplify each expression outside the parentheses

(-41) * (-3) = ?

Step 3: Combine like terms

No like terms to combine

Step 4: Perform any necessary simplifications

No simplifications needed

Step 5: Evaluate the final expression

(-41) * (-3) = 123

Answer: The answer is 123.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example:

Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside each pair of parentheses first

(-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = -9 * (7 * 7 * -9) = -9 * (-49 * 9) = -9 * -441 = 3969

(4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = 4 * -9 - 8 + 4 = -36 - 4 = -40

Step 2: Simplify each expression outside the parentheses

3969 + (-40) = 3969 - 40 = 3929

Step 3: Combine like terms

No like terms to combine

Step 4: Perform any necessary simplifications

No simplifications needed

Step 5: Evaluate the final expression

3929

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example:

Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:

Step 1: Evaluate the expression inside each pair of parentheses first

(-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = ?

First, evaluate the expression inside the first pair of parentheses:

5 * 8 = 40
40 * -4 = -160
-3 + (-160) = -163

So, (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = -163

(9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = ?

First, evaluate the expression inside the second pair of parentheses:

8 * -7 = -56
9 - (-56) = 65
65 + (-9) = 56

So, (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = 56

Step 2: Simplify each expression outside the parentheses

(-163) - 56 = ?

Subtract 56 from -163:

-163 - 56 = -219

Step 3: Combine like terms

No like terms to combine

Step 4: Perform any necessary simplifications

No simplifications needed

Step 5: Evaluate the final expression

The final expression is -219

Answer: The answer is -219.
