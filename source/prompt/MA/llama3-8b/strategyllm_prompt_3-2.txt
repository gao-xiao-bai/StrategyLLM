Strategy:
Here is a general strategy to solve multi-step arithmetic problems:

1. **Separate the problem into smaller expressions**: Break down the problem into smaller, manageable expressions using parentheses, if necessary. This will help to avoid confusion and ensure accurate evaluation of the problem.

2. **Evaluate expressions inside parentheses**: Evaluate each expression inside parentheses first, working from the innermost to the outermost. This will help to simplify the problem and reduce the number of calculations required.

3. **Follow order of operations (PEMDAS)**: Once expressions inside parentheses have been evaluated, follow the order of operations (PEMDAS): parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.

4. **Simplify expressions**: Simplify each expression by combining like terms and evaluating any additional calculations.

5. **Repeat steps 2-4**: Continue evaluating expressions inside parentheses, following the order of operations, and simplifying until the problem has been fully evaluated.

6. **Check your answer**: Verify that the final answer is reasonable and accurate by checking your calculations and plugging in known values.

By following these subtasks in this order, you can systematically solve multi-step arithmetic problems and arrive at the correct solution.

Examples:
Here is the step-by-step solution to the example:

Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:

Step 1: Separate the problem into smaller expressions
(((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Step 2: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses
(-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = ? (evaluate the expression inside the innermost parentheses)
9 * -4 = -36
-5 + (-36) - 0 = -41

So, (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = -41

Now, evaluate the expression inside the outermost parentheses:
(-41) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = ?

Step 3: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses
4 + -7 + 0 * -5 = ? (evaluate the expression inside the innermost parentheses)
0 * -5 = 0
4 + -7 + 0 = -3

So, 4 + -7 + 0 * -5 = -3

Now, multiply -41 by -3:
(-41) * (-3) = 123

Step 4: Simplify expressions
No further simplification is needed.

Step 5: Repeat steps 2-4
No further calculations are needed.

Step 6: Check your answer
The final answer is 123, which is reasonable and accurate.

Answer: The answer is 123.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example:

Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:

Step 1: Separate the problem into smaller expressions
(-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)

Step 2: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses
(-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = ?

First, evaluate the expression inside the innermost parentheses:
4 * -9 = -36
-36 - 8 = -44
-44 - -4 = -40

So, the expression becomes:
(-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (-40)

Step 3: Follow order of operations (PEMDAS)
Evaluate the expression inside the outermost parentheses:
-9 * 7 = -63
-63 * 7 = -441
-441 * -9 = 3969

Now, the expression becomes:
3969 + (-40)

Step 4: Simplify expressions
3969 + (-40) = 3929

Step 5: Repeat steps 2-4
No further simplification is possible.

Step 6: Check your answer
The final answer is 3929, which is reasonable and accurate.

Answer: The answer is 3929.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example:

Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:

Step 1: Separate the problem into smaller expressions
(-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)

Step 2: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses
(-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (-3 + 5 * (-32)) - (9 + 56 + -9)

Step 3: Follow order of operations (PEMDAS)
(-3 + 5 * (-32)) - (9 + 56 + -9) = (-3 + -160) - (9 + 56 + -9)

Step 4: Simplify expressions
(-3 + -160) - (9 + 56 + -9) = -163 - (9 + 56 + -9)

Step 5: Simplify expressions
-163 - (9 + 56 + -9) = -163 - 56 - 9

Step 6: Simplify expressions
-163 - 56 - 9 = -228

Answer: The answer is -219.
