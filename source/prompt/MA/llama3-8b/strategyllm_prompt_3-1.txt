Strategy:
Here is a strategy to solve multi-step arithmetic problems:

1. **Read and understand the problem**: Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.

2. **Simplify the problem by combining like terms**: Look for terms that can be combined using the commutative and associative properties of addition and multiplication. Combine them to simplify the expression.

3. **Evaluate expressions inside parentheses**: Work within the parentheses first, using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BPEALS). Evaluate expressions that are inside parentheses before moving on to the next step.

4. **Evaluate multiplication and division operations**: Evaluate any multiplication or division operations that are not enclosed in parentheses, working from left to right.

5. **Evaluate addition and subtraction operations**: Finally, evaluate any addition and subtraction operations, working from left to right.

6. **Combine remaining terms and simplify**: Combine any remaining terms and simplify the expression as much as possible.

7. **Check the answer (optional)**: If desired, check the answer by plugging it back into the original problem to ensure that it is correct.

This strategy should help make the task of solving multi-step arithmetic problems more manageable by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable subtasks.

Examples:
Here is the step-by-step solution to the example:

Question: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =

Solution:

Step 1: Read and understand the problem
The problem is a multi-step arithmetic expression enclosed in parentheses. We need to simplify and evaluate the expression step by step.

Step 2: Simplify the problem by combining like terms
The expression can be simplified by combining the terms inside the parentheses:
(-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -41
(4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 - 7 + 0) = -3

So, the simplified expression is:
(-41) * (-3)

Step 3: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses
We have already simplified the expressions inside the parentheses, so there is nothing to evaluate.

Step 4: Evaluate multiplication and division operations
We have a multiplication operation:
(-41) * (-3) = 123

Step 5: Evaluate addition and subtraction operations
There are no addition or subtraction operations to evaluate.

Step 6: Combine remaining terms and simplify
The final result is:
123

Answer: The answer is 123.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example:

Question: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =

Solution:

Step 1: Read and understand the problem
The problem is a multi-step arithmetic expression that involves multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. We need to simplify the expression by combining like terms, evaluating expressions inside parentheses, and following the order of operations.

Step 2: Simplify the problem by combining like terms
The expression can be simplified by combining the terms inside the parentheses:

(-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4) = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (-9 * 4 - 8 + 4)

Step 3: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses
Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:

(-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = -3969
(-9 * 4 - 8 + 4) = -36

So, the simplified expression is:

-3969 + (-36) = ?

Step 4: Evaluate multiplication and division operations
There are no multiplication or division operations in this expression, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 5: Evaluate addition and subtraction operations
Evaluate the addition and subtraction operations from left to right:

-3969 + (-36) = -4005

Step 6: Combine remaining terms and simplify
The expression is already simplified, so we can move on to the next step.

Step 7: Check the answer (optional)
We can check the answer by plugging it back into the original problem:

((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) = -4005

The answer is correct.

Answer: The answer is 4005.



Here is the step-by-step solution to the example:

Question: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =

Solution:

Step 1: Read and understand the problem
The problem is a multi-step arithmetic expression that involves parentheses, multiplication, and subtraction.

Step 2: Simplify the problem by combining like terms
There are no like terms to combine in this expression.

Step 3: Evaluate expressions inside parentheses
Evaluate the expression inside the first set of parentheses:
(-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = ?

Evaluate the multiplication operation:
5 * 8 = 40
(-3 + 40 * -4) = ?

Evaluate the multiplication operation:
40 * -4 = -160
(-3 + -160) = ?

Evaluate the addition operation:
-3 + -160 = -163

So, the expression inside the first set of parentheses is equal to -163.

Step 4: Evaluate multiplication and division operations
There are no multiplication or division operations outside the parentheses.

Step 5: Evaluate addition and subtraction operations
Evaluate the expression inside the second set of parentheses:
(9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = ?

Evaluate the multiplication operation:
8 * -7 = -56
(9 - -56 + -9) = ?

Evaluate the addition and subtraction operations:
9 + 56 = 65
65 - 9 = 56

So, the expression inside the second set of parentheses is equal to 56.

Step 6: Combine remaining terms and simplify
Combine the two expressions:
(-163) - 56 = ?

Evaluate the subtraction operation:
-163 - 56 = -219

So, the final answer is -219.

Answer: The answer is -219.
